      <abstract id="aspace_f2ba1e1cc754c117de99e3b96462f797">Frances Duncan grew up in the New York area. While in high school, she was an avid fan of the Riot Grrrl music scene, especially the band Sleater-Kinney, and performed in her own band, Tryke. In the late 1990s, she received her undergraduate degree in writing from Sarah Lawrence College while designing websites for Riot Grrrl bands from the Pacific Northwest in her spare time. This collection features items created and collected by Duncan in her teens and early twenties documenting her involvement in the Riot Grrrl movement. Materials include diaries, day planners, notebooks, zines, photographs, art originals, and cassette tapes, as well as artifacts and memorabilia. The collection also includes a metal lunchbox covered in stickers and containing handcuffs and a nightgown. Bands prominently featured in the collection include Sleater-Kinney, Nilla, Marmalade, Versus and Vitapup.</abstract>
