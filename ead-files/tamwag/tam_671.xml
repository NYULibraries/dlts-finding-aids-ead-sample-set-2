      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Daniel J. Walkowitz is a professor Emeritus of history and metropolitan studies at New York University. He received his doctorate from the University of Rochester in 1972 where he studied under labor historian Herbert Gutman. He began teaching history at New York University in 1978 specializing in labor history, urban history, and public history. He co-founded NYU's graduate public history program in 1981 and also headed the undergraduate program in metropolitan studies. Combing history with an interest in filmmaking, Walkowitz co-directed several historical documentaries and dramatizations for PBS with NYU media studies Professor Barbara Abrash, including <emph render="italic">The Molders of Troy</emph>, which drew upon Walkowitz's doctoral research and his 1978 book, <emph render="italic">Worker City, Company Town</emph>. His other books include <emph render="italic">Workers of the Donbass Speak: Survival and Identity in the New Ukraine</emph>, with Lewis H. Siegelbaum, 1995;  <emph render="italic">Working with Class: Social Workers and the Politics of Middle Class Identity</emph>, 1999; and <emph render="italic">City Folk: English Country Dance and the Politics of the Folk in Modern America</emph>, 2010.  He adapted <emph render="italic">City Folk</emph> into a documentary in 2014.</p>

      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>At the time of accessioning materials in this collection were moved into archival boxes, but original folders have been maintained. Materials have largely been retained in the order in which they were received. Several groupings of files, which were spread across several boxes, were reunited upon rehousing when a clear original order that had been disrupted was apparent.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The Daniel J. Walkowitz Papers (dates 1967-2007) contain papers and video recordings related to the academic work and public history projects of historian and New York University professor Daniel J. Walkowitz. His papers include research files related to his book, <emph render="italic">Working with Class</emph>, concerning social work and Jewish philanthropic organizations in New York City from the 1910s to the 1960s. These files contain photocopies from archival collections of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, Jewish Board of Guardians, and the Social Service Employees' Union as well as newspaper clippings and secondary articles related to the topic. The files were compiled in the late 1980s and early 1990s and also contain Walkowitz's handwritten notes. Other research files in this collection relate to English folk dancing in the United States, and include transcripts of original oral history interviews, the majority of which were conducted by Walkowitz. The interviews date from 1999 and 2004, and were collected as research for his book <emph render="italic">City Folk</emph>. The collection also contains materials related to Walkowitz's historical films. These materials include copies of National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) grant proposals, scripts, correspondence with collaborators, notes, research, and budgets. Films most prominently represented in this collection include <emph render="italic">Molders of Troy</emph>, <emph render="italic">Sisters</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Perestroika from Below</emph>, documenting iron workers in Troy, NY; class and gender in America; and a 1989 mass strike of mine workers in the Soviet Union. Walkowitz worked on these projects with his colleague Barbara Abrash from 1979 through the 1990s under the name Past Time Productions. Recordings of <emph render="italic">Molders of Troy</emph> and <emph render="italic">Perestroika from Below</emph> are included in the collection on reel-to-reel, VHS, and DVD. Additionally the collection contains a small amount of Walkowitz's teaching materials which consist of syllabi, course lists, lecture notes, and files related to departmental programs.</p>
