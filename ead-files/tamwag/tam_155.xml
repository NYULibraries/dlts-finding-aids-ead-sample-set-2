      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>NARAL/NY is the New York State affiliate of the National Abortion Rights Action League. In fact, NARAL/NY was the organization's first chapter, whose founding in 1971 preceded that of the national organization by several years. NARAL/NY works at the legislative, electoral, and grassroots levels to protect safe, legal abortion and
expand the full range of reproductive rights for all women. NARAL/NY has a political action committee, a foundation which produces a variety of educational materials and training programs, including the Pro-Choice Shopping Guide, the Abortion Sourcebook, the Pro-Choice Media Project, the Hospital Abortion Providers
Project, and the Youth Training Initiative.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>This collection contains correspondence, memos, reports, minutes, proceedings, petitions, flyers, clippings, press releases, reference and research files, audiocassettes and videocassettes. The bulk of the material is from 1980 onwards. There are proceedings of NARAL conventions, annual reports, incomplete board minutes and
officers' correspondence. </p>
      <p>The largest portion of the collection documents the NARAL Political Action Committee's efforts, which focused on lobbying in support of, or in opposition to, various proposed abortion legislation, and supporting or opposing state, county, and local candidates for public office. NARAL produced position papers, campaign information packets, telegrams, press releases, compiled information on candidates. The records detail the activities of local NARAL activists, as well as that of the State organization. There are also Ô¨Åles from various NARAL committees and projects, notably their Pro-Choice Media Project, which monitors media coverage of, and informs the public about, abortion issues. The audio/video cassettes document the work of the Media Project, and various NARAL public programs, and meetings. </p>
