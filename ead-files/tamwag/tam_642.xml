      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p><emph render="italic">Dissent</emph> is a quarterly magazine of political and social criticism. Founded in 1954 by Irving Howe, Emanuel Geltman, and Stanley Plastrik, <emph render="italic">Dissent</emph> has published articles critiquing the political ideologies of the left and right for over 60 years. Informed by democratic socialist ideology and intellectuals on the political left, <emph render="italic">Dissent</emph>'s founders positioned the magazine in contrast to the liberalism of the West and communism of the East. Although <emph render="italic">Dissent</emph> identifies itself with the democratic socialism of its founders, its editors and contributors represent a broad spectrum of political outlooks. Since its formation, it has published articles by a number of prominent intellectuals including Hannah Arendt, Norman Mailer, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Ellen Willis, Richard Wright, George Packer, as well as many others.</p>
      <p>Irving Howe served as <emph render="italic">Dissent</emph>'s first editor from 1954 until his death in 1993. Following Howe's death, Mitchell Cohen and Michael Walzer served as co-editors of the magazine until 2013. The current editor of <emph render="italic">Dissent</emph> magazine is historian Michael Kazin.  </p>

          <p>Founded in 1954 by Irving Howe, Dissent Magazine is a quarterly leftist/social democratic intellectual magazine of politics and culture edited by Michael Kazin and Michael Walzer. Informed by democratic socialist ideology and intellectuals on the political left, <emph render="italic">Dissent</emph>'s founders positioned the magazine in contrast to the liberalism of the West and communism of the East. Although <emph render="italic">Dissent</emph> identifies itself with the democratic socialism of its founders, its editors and contributors represent a broad spectrum of political outlooks. Since its formation, it has published articles by a number of prominent intellectuals including Hannah Arendt, Norman Mailer, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Ellen Willis, Richard Wright, George Packer, as well as many others.</p>
          <p>Dissent's archived website contains direct links to articles from current issues and back issues, a blog, online articles, podcasts, videos, events, and topical issues. The website captures from the Communism, Socialism, Trotskyism Web Archive are more comprehensive than that of the Other Left Activism Web Archive. Back issues are only accessible through the Communism, Socialism, Trotskyism Web Archive. The Belabored Podcast which was created in 2013 is accessible through the Communism, Socialism, Trotskyism Web Archive, but can be only be played back from captures from 2017 onwards. The podcast episodes are not downloadable. The search function is not available through either web archive. The website was first captured in 2007.</p>
