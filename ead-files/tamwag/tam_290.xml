      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>WBAI Radio (New York, N.Y.) is a radio station that is part of of Pacifica Radio, a small national network politically left radio stations in the United States, including stations in Berkeley (KPFA), Los Angeles a(KPFK), Houston (KPFT), New York (WBAI), and Washington, DC (WPFW). Pacifica was founded in 1946 by pacifist Lewis Hill. For most of its history, Pacifica gave each of its stations independent control of programming. Then, during the 1990s, a major controversy arose over allegations that the Pacifica National Board and national staff were attempting to centralize control of content, in order to increase listenership, and that the board proposed changing the network's funding model away from reliance on listener donations and toward corporate foundation funding. There were also accusations that the Board was considering selling both KPFA in Berkeley, California and WBAI in New York City, which operate on commercial broadcast channels, and whose frequencies are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. This led to years of conflict, including court cases, public demonstrations, firings and strikes of station staff. Many listeners to the individual stations, including WBAI, objected to what they saw as an attempt to tone down the overtly political content on Pacifica stations. The board eventually was embroiled in counter lawsuits by board members and listener-sponsors, and after global settlement of the lawsuits in November 2001, an interim board was formed to craft new bylaws, which it did in two tumultuous years of national debates among thousands of listener-sponsors and activists, finally giving listener-sponsors the right and responsibility to elect new Local Station Boards at each of the five Pacifica stations. These local boards in turn elect the national board of directors. Aside from some minor changes, the same 2003 bylaws remain in effect today.</p>
