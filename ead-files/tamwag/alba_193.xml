Five are from George Watt, then in the US Army;  three of these are to Milt Wolff.  Two letters are about George Watt.

      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>From an early age, George Watt (b. 1913) was involved in Communist activities, serving as executive secretary of the Communist National Student League. From 1937-1939, he was a political commissar in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade during the Spanish Civil War. Watt later served as a sergeant in the Army Air Force during World War II. </p>
      <p>After the war, Watt became an official of the American Communist Party. He was one of a group of party officers convicted of sedition in 1953 (the conviction was overturned on appeal). Watt broke with the Communist Party in 1958. He died in 1994 at age 80.</p>
