      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Girolamo Valenti (1893-1958) was an anti-fascist, anti-communist Italian-American labor leader, socialist, and editor. He was born in Valguarnera, Sicily, and came to the United States in 1911. There he worked as a labor organizer for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers in the eastern United States, as well as for the American Shoe Workers Protective Union. He was also editor of several Italian-American newspapers, including the antifascist daily <title render="italic">Il Nuovo Mondo</title>(1925-1931), <title render="italic">La Stampa Libera</title>, <title render="italic">La Parola del Popolo</title>(New York), <title render="italic">and Parola dei Socialisti</title>. He also published at least one article in mainstream, English-language publications, including a photo-essay published in <title render="italic">Look</title>magazine (December 17, 1940), "Italian Fascist Propaganda in the United States," that contains photographs of Italian-American fascist rallies and gatherings. During World War II Valenti served as a consultant to the chief of the Italian desk at the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). He was a leader of the Italian Social Democratic Party and of the Circulo Matteotti, an organization whose purpose was to support left anti-communism in Italy and among Italian-Americans. He also was a radio commentator for several different Italian-language programs at stations in New York City, Philadelphia, and New Britain, Connecticut.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>Collection consists of 11 black and white photographs of varying sizes, including two small panoramic prints, a 1940 photograph essay from <title render="italic">Look</title>magazine written by Girolamo Valenti, two clippings of photographs from periodicals or newspapers, and one copper printing plate, possibly from one of the Socialist or anti-Fascist publications that Valenti edited.</p>
      <p>Images are of anti-fascist rallies outdoors in New York City in the 1930s (one may be as early as in the 1920s). These include one demonstration that took place after Mussolini declared war on the United States, with placards (in English and Italian) representing different Italian or Italian-American organizations, including "Anti-Fascisti di Staten Island," "Partito Socialista Italiano," and "Partito Repubblicano Italiano"; another print appears to be a demonstration supporting the Loyalists in Spain. Locations include Washington Square, and possibly Central Park and Union Square. In addition, there are also snapshots of Valenti, by himself, and with others unidentified and identified, including "[possibly Humbert], Gualtieri," "[E.R.]Pacciaroli," "[possibly Guiseppe] Lupis." The clippings contain photographs of Gaspare Nicotri and E.R. Pacciaroli, and Giuseppe Modigliani (leader of the Italian Socialist Party and member of antifascist movement).</p>
