      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Class of 1892 attended the University of the City of New York (now New York University) during a period of transition in the university's history. When the twenty-two members entered as freshmen in 1888, the university was a small educational institution entirely located around Washington Square in Manhattan. The inauguration of Henry Mitchell MacCracken as Chancellor in 1891 marked the beginning of a large-scale expansion of the university's mission, activities, and student body.  
The Class of 1892 was one of the last to graduate from the University of the City of New York before the College of Arts and Science moved to a new campus at University Heights. This was also one of the first classes to have its activities regularly documented in a yearbook.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Class of 1892 Scrapbook is a single bound volume containing photographs and Commencement ephemera of the University of the City of New York (now New York University) Class of 1892. The majority of the volume is made up of individual photographs of fifteen of the twenty two members of the undergraduate class, taken around the time of their graduation from the university. Contemporaneous photographs of university faculty members are also present. The last few pages of the volume contain invitations and programs from events related to the Commencement ceremonies of 1892.</p>
      <p>The volume appears to have been maintained by the class statistician, Arthur C. Perry, after graduation. On the inside of the front cover, Perry noted the names and fraternity affiliations of the class members, including those not pictured in the volume. He also noted which members of the class were deceased.</p>
