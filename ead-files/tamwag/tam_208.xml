      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>Processing, arrangement and description interventions to this collection prior to 2019 were not records. Records were rehoused and described at the collection level. Loose documents that arrived as a part of the 2019 accretion were rehoused in archival folders. Some elements of the finding aid were updated to reflect changes in the collection's date, scope, contents, and extent. In 2019 the collection title was changed from the Henry Turner Papers to the Harry Turner Papers to reflect the creator's preferred form of name.</p>
