    <abstract id="aspace_53431f8c58c20c2c9dd9509769f87def">Sidney Jonas, a labor union organizer, began his career by organizing shoe-workers. In 1934, he was appointed as a fieldworker for the United Shoe and Leather Workers Union. In 1936, United Automobile Workers (UAW-CIO) president, Homer Martin, appointed Jonas as his personal representative and director of the Northeast Region for the UAW-CIO. Jonas worked in this capacity until 1938. This small collection of mostly black and white photographs includes shots of a crowd gathered at Cadillac Square, Detroit, in support of the Flint sit-down strikers in 1937 and a similar demonstration in front of Ford Headquarters in New York City that same year.</abstract>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>This small collection of mostly black and white photographs provides documentation for an important period in the history of the United Autoworkers (UAW). Included are shots of the crowd gathered at Cadillac Square, Detroit, in support of the Flint sit-down strikers (1937), as well as a similar demonstration in front of Ford Headquarters in New York that same year. Another image shows UAW President Homer Martin speaking during the organizing campaign at the Tarrytown, New York Chevrolet Plant (1937). A group portrait at the UAW South Bend Convention (nd) shows Frank Tussi, George Addes and Homer Martin of the UAW with CIO leaders John Lewis, David Dubinsky and John Brophy. Six snapshots provide an informal view of life at Brookwood Labor College. Copyright to all but one of the copy prints belongs to photographer Lucienne Bloch; these require permission to be reproduced. There are also another half-dozen photographs, with no captions or identifying information, that appear to have been shot during the latter part of Jonas' life (they may include images of him as an elderly man).</p>  </scopecontent>
