      <abstract id="aspace_907046cf9f55ec5618ffc15a4b9c063d">Margaret Nagle was an Irish emigrant from County Cork, who lived and worked in New York City as a domestic servant in the 1860s. This collection consists of scans and typescripts of letters written between Nagle and members of her family in the late 1860s and early 1870s. Nagle dictated her letters to a professional letter-writer in New York City and kept the drafts while the finished versions were sent to her family in Cork. The letters detail everyday activities and document the ways in which illiterate or semi-literate immigrants communicated with their families in a written format.</abstract>

      <p>Researchers interested in using electronic records in this collection  must use a transferred copy, which we refer to as an access copy. Researchers may view an item's original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that already have already been transferred are noted in the collection's finding aid and can be requested in our reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@nyu.edu with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested. A librarian will respond to you with further information.</p>
