    <abstract id="aspace_c17aab76bcc1fce34a025e7de4413f1c">Born Martin Victor Wong in Portland, Oregon on July 11, 1946, Wong was raised by his Chinese-American parents in San Francisco. Wong was involved in performance art in the 1970's, but focused almost exclusively on painting after moving to New York in the early 1980's. The self-taught Wong, whose work showed a distinct gay sensibility, became a respected, renowned and prolific painter in New York's downtown art scene. He also cultivated both working and personal relationships with graffiti artists and enthusiasts in that scene. His compositions combine gritty social documents, cosmic witticisms, and symbolic languages that chronicle survival in his drug-and-crime-besieged Lower East Side neighborhood. In addition to his painting, Wong also experimented with poetry and prose, much of which he recorded on long paper scrolls. Wong died of AIDS in 1999.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Martin Wong is known for his paintings of gritty cityscapes, including New York's Chinatown and Lower East Side, and for championing graffiti a legitimate art form in the 1980's and 1990's. Wong was a respected and prolific painter in New York's downtown art scene in the 1980's. In addition, Wong cultivated both working and personal relationships with graffiti artists and enthusiasts. </p><p>Born Martin Victor Wong (although he sometimes playfully lists himself as "Martin Genghis Wong") in Portland, OR, on July 11, 1946, Wong was raised by his Chinese-American parents in San Francisco. He graduated from George Washington High School in 1964. Wong was involved in performance art in the 1970's, but focused almost exclusively on painting after moving to New York in the early 1980's.</p><p>In addition to his painting, Wong experimented with poetry and prose, much of which he recorded on long paper scrolls. Highly anecdotal and semi-autobiographical, Wong's writing features an exuberant and fanciful stream-of-consciousness style.</p><p>Fascinated by New York's renegade graffiti artists, Wong befriended such spray-can virtuosos as "Daze" (Chris Ellis), "Lee," "Laroc," and "LA2," among others. Wong forged a particularly strong and enduring friendship with Daze, and helped publicize his work, as well as the work of other graffiti artists, in exhibitions and through the Museum of American Graffiti. This grassroots institution was devised to showcase the vibrant panoply of contemporary graffiti art.</p><p>Wong's circle also included arts journalist Theresa Herron, Steve Hernandez, "Magic Sam," artist John Ahearn, "Lady" Joyce Ryan, Barry Blinderman, and Wendy Olsoff and Penny Pilkington of the PPOW gallery. Also significant in Wong's life were his mother, Mrs. Benjamin Wong Fie, and his "Aunt Nora" (a.k.a. Aunt Ellie), Eleanora Tam. In artistic terms, one of Wong's most significant relationships was that shared with poet and playwright Miguel Pinero, whom Wong met in 1982. Affectionately referred to by Wong as both "Mikey" and "Mickey," Pinero was considered "Loisaida's reigning outlaw poet" (Sweet Oblivion, 35). A some-time roommate of Wong's, Pinero collaborated with Wong on such paintings as "Attorney Street Handball Court" (1982-84) and "Little Got Rained On" (1983). Pinero's text was incorporated into the paintings such that Wong's imagery serves as evocative illustration. Pinero also appears not infrequently in Wong's paintings as subject - "Portrait of Pinero" (1982), "Penitentiary Fox" (1988), "La Vida" (1988) - where he is typically depicted reading or writing.</p><p>In the span of a decade, Wong achieved considerable recognition and success, with a formidable arsenal of solo and group exhibitions to his credit. Wong is most closely associated with downtown galleries Semaphore, Exit Art, and PPOW, but his work has also appeared at such venues as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New Museum of Contemporary Art, and the New York Historical Society. Wong died in 1999, after a protracted battle with AIDS. </p><p> Sources/Related Material: </p><p><list><item> The Clones of Bruce Lee [videorecording]: the art of Martin Wong.

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Martin Wong Papers are a part of the Downtown Collection at the Fales Library, New York University. The Fales Library is the primary special collections division of the NYU libraries, housing nearly 200,000 volumes of English and American literature from 1700 to the present. Strengths of the collection include the development of the English and American novel, with an emphasis on the Gothic and the Victorian novel. The Downtown Collection, of which the Martin Wong Papers are a part, is a comprehensive collection of printed materials, archives, and other materials related to the Downtown New York scene from ca. 1975 to the present.</p><p>The Martin Wong Papers are comprised of over 100 sketches and drawings, more than 30 sketchbooks, correspondence, poetry and prose, biographical documents, source material, audio and videocassette recordings, photos, and graffiti tag-books, graffiti-related materials and parts of Wong's personal library. </p><p>Source material includes magazines, postcards, posters, memorabilia, and a vast collection of Wong's snapshots. Biographical material features Wong's curriculum vitae, copies of newspaper and magazine profiles of Wong, business cards and addresses of associates, and publicity materials related to Wong's exhibitions. Wong's poetry and prose contains a significant portion of the biographical material - much of it anecdotal in tone. The graffiti portion of the archive is comprehensive and includes sketchbooks, illustrations, text on graffiti (authored by both Wong and others), publicity material pertaining to graffiti exhibitions, and materials pertaining to the graffiti film: "Wild Style." Of particular interest are the numerous examples of tagging found in both the sketchbooks and other artwork.</p><p>A zealous collector and graffiti enthusiast, Wong amassed a considerable cache of graffiti material in the 1980's. The Martin Wong Papers also document New York's downtown arts scene in the 1980's and 1990's, with particular emphasis on Wong's participation and recognition in the gallery scene. </p><p><emph render="bold">SERIES DESCRIPTION</emph></p><p><emph render="bold">Series I: Correspondence</emph> contains a box of documents ordered alphabetically by correspondent's last name (in most cases).

Once upon a time<lb/>
there was this woman named Kacey<lb/>
Who lived in a trailor<lb/>
Across from the Shop-rite<lb/>
who used to dye the hair of all the<lb/> 
Department-store beauty-queens<lb/>
 who used to ride on the floats in the Orange bowl parades<lb/>
she used to dye them orange and purple and green and glitter <lb/>
that but orange bowl was only once a year <lb/>
so the rest of the time she would color her own her own hair <lb/>
all kinds of colors<lb/>
 first she would dye it purple <lb/>
then she'd strip it and dye it green <lb/>
and then strip it and then do a whole<lb/>
Rainbow<lb/>
Trip on it.<lb/>
This went on<lb/>
 day in and day out<lb/>
 year after year <lb/>
till finally one day she just died <lb/>
At the autopsy the corner<lb/> 
discovered that the dye <lb/>
had seeped down through her scalp <lb/>
and dyed her brain<lb/>
Every imaginable<lb/>

A true story by Martin Wong<lb/> 
Once upon a time<lb/>
I think it was either Michigan Boulevard in Wisconsin 
or maybe<lb/> 
it was Wisconsin Boulevard in Michigan<lb/> 
anyway it was<lb/>
America<lb/>
Somewhere <lb/>
Brian and Jabbo were driving around<lb/> 
nowhere to go <lb/>
so Jabbo he pulled down his pants<lb/> 
stuck a cigarette in his big hairy butt<lb/> 
and put a hat on it so it looked like a gross<lb/>
Little man with a incredibly ugly face<lb/> 
and no eyes then<lb/> 
they drove up to the guy on the corner<lb/> 
and he says "hey man you know the way to Lakeside Drive? "<lb/>
And when the guy<lb/>
he turned around<lb/>
he was so shocked<lb/>
he puked on the spot!</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref715" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sign Language Art</unittitle><unitdate>undated</unitdate><container altrender="Flat OS Box - 21 x 3.5 x 17" id="aspace_c263bafafad1124ea4c53095b7d81a8c" label="Mixed Materials [31142062838274]" type="box">17</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f6cdafd55608f9be74e17338ef262962"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>These peices show drawings of hands making American Sign Language signs for letters of the alphabet.</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_ref203" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries B: Art by Others</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref204" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Kostabi mini-figures (copy)</unittitle><unitdate>undated</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_a4ef23d606c204975636ddc2cb5f3b00" label="Mixed Materials [31142063598158]" type="box">3a.</container><container id="aspace_623568f418ca6797a0e7ce434819a577" parent="aspace_a4ef23d606c204975636ddc2cb5f3b00" type="folder">130</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref205" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Drawing: "Trent &amp; Revonda," by John Ahearn</unittitle><unitdate>undated</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_53dd565b8896f649889d7d265ccdd3ae" label="Mixed Materials [31142063598158]" type="box">3a.</container><container id="aspace_aae9a6d5c037939936a83dfcf52983ef" parent="aspace_53dd565b8896f649889d7d265ccdd3ae" type="folder">131</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref206" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Drawing: portrait of a man (artist unknown)</unittitle><unitdate>undated</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_b3ba2c6bfd4f31b6a194a18e649704f1" label="Mixed Materials [31142063598158]" type="box">3a.</container><container id="aspace_adb6550aedc943770c870b7e5724d666" parent="aspace_b3ba2c6bfd4f31b6a194a18e649704f1" type="folder">132</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref207" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Copy of John Ahearn's sketchbook</unittitle><unitdate>undated</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_001f1339ea3dad8780ec0d3a1c712f7e" label="Mixed Materials [31142063598158]" type="box">3a.</container><container id="aspace_f17566b5ba0cd027a0f35f4cb6252187" parent="aspace_001f1339ea3dad8780ec0d3a1c712f7e" type="folder">133</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref208" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Painting: abstract, signed by R.
