    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Frances Hovey Stoddard was born in Middlebury, Vermont, on April 25, 1847.  He graduated with an A.B. with high honors from Amherst College in 1869 and subsequently began teaching.  He married Lucy Maria in Springfield, Massachusetts on May 14, 1873, and they had a daughter, Lucy Stoddard.  After 1873 Stoddard worked for several years in the cotton manufacturing business in Northampton, Massachusetts.  He was a student at Oxford University from 1884-1886 and afterward spent two years at the University of California as an instructor of English literature.  In 1888 Stoddard became Professor of English Language and Literature at New York University; he held that title until he retired in 1914 as Professor Emeritus. It was during his first year at NYU that the University began admitting graduate students as candidates for the doctoral degree.   He also served as the Dean of the Faculty of the College of Arts and Pure Science (subsequently the College of Arts and Science) from 1910-1914.  </p><p>Stoddard's published works include: <emph render="italic">The Modern Novel</emph> (1883); <emph render="italic">The Ideal in Literature</emph> (1884); <emph render="italic">Psycho-Biography</emph> (1885); <emph render="italic">Women in the English Universities</emph> (1886); <emph render="italic">The Caedmon Poems</emph>, <emph render="italic">Conditions of Labor in England</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Miracle Plays and Mysteries</emph> (1887); <emph render="italic">Tolstoi and Matthew Arnold</emph> (1888); <emph render="italic">The Uses of Rhetoric and Inductive Work in College Classes</emph> (1890); <emph render="italic">The Study of the English Language</emph> (1894), <emph render="italic">Lord Byron: Introduction to Works</emph> (1899); <emph render="italic">The Evolution of the English Novel</emph> (1900), and the <emph render="italic">Life of Charles Butler</emph> (1903).
