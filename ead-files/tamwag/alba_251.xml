The records reveal surveillance of the organization starting in 1940 and continuing into 1965. The FBI applied some exemptions to the records, resulting in redacted portions in certain documents. These FOIA requests were made by Julia Newman, former executive director of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives (ALBA), an organization of friends and family of veterans, academics, and others interested in exploring and preserving the history of the Lincoln Brigade. 

The records contain lists of membership in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, histories of VALB, copies of pamphlets, and other organizational material, news reports that mention VALB, excerpts from books and articles about VALB, documents from the third National Convention of Veterans, and reports detailing the formation, purpose, activities, publications, officers and sponsors of VALB chapters around the country.</abstract>
