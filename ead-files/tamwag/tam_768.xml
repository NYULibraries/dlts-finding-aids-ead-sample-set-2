      <abstract id="aspace_9fc3b4cd9f25bdb5600df87bcddf6a62">The collection consists of photographic slides taken in 1957 by Earl Williamson during the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students for Peace and Friendship and in the subsequent American Youth Delegation to China that same year. The images from the USSR portray Moscow during the festival and young Communist delegates from around the world, while the images from China portray the cities and countryside of the newly Communist nation in its nascent stages of development. These photographs reflect the efforts of American citizens to independently document the political and cultural world of Communist nations during the Cold War.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Earl Williamson (b. 1928/1929?) is one of 41 American students and teachers who participated in the American Youth Delegation to China in 1957, after attending the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students for Peace and Friendship held in Moscow that same year. Prior to this visit, Williamson had been a chemistry teacher in Oakland, California. Williamson was the first member of the delegation to return to the U.S. from China, and upon returning he had his passport revoked by the U.S. government and was subpoenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). While cooperative with the U.S. government throughout the process, Williamson was vocally critical of U.S. perceptions of China, maintaining that the right to travel and the right to free thought were essential American values in spite of anti-Communist U.S. foreign and domestic policies during the Cold War. </p>
