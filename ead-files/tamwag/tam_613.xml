    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Asian American Arts Centre, founded in 1974 as Asian American Dance Theatre, is one of the older community arts organizations in New York City Chinatown. The current name, Asian American Arts Centre, was adopted in 1987 to encompass both the dance company (Asian American Dance Theatre) and the visual arts program, Asian Arts Institute, initiated in 1984.</p><p>The Asian American Arts Centre began the Asian American Artists' Slide Archive in 1982. Artist vertical files were developed and accumulated as a permanent research archive documenting the history of Asian/Pacific American Artists in the United States since 1945 to the present. The archive contains not only slides but also a variety of materials that are both primary and secondary sources from approximately 1,500 artists. </p><p>In 1986, the Asian American Art Centre initiated a research project with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation called the "Milieu" series. The project focused on Asian American artists from the post World War era (1945 to1965), contextualized them and their artwork within this historical setting, and provided a historical precedent for the cultural presence of young Asian American artists. About ninety artists who began their career between 1945 to 1965 were selected and extensive research was conducted for many of them, resulting in extensive documents and materials in their files. Some were interviewed in their native language and documentation from these interviews has also been archived. </p><p>In 2007, the Asian American Art Centre created a new archive, the AAAC Artist Archive, from a part of the original slide archive as part of its digitization project. 150 artists who exemplified the major issues that compose the subject of Asian American art were selected and their materials processed for long-term archival preservation. Selected materials from these 150 artists were in turn digitized and made available on the website http://artasiamerica.org. The centre's creation of and commitment to preserve and make accessible its Artist Archive is part of the organization's greater mission to "promote the preservation and creative vitality of Asian American cultural growth through the arts, and its historical and aesthetic linkage to other communities."</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection is primarily comprised of the organizational records of the Asian American Arts Centre. It is also contains the files of the Asian American Dance Theatre and the Asian Arts Institute, which merged to form Asian American Arts Center in 1987. Included in the collection are planning materials and publicity for Asian American Arts Centre exhibitions and other programming in the areas of Asian folk arts, international politics (such as the "China - June 4th, 1989" exhibition on the Tiananmen Square protests), and life and events in New York City (such as the exhibitions "Below the Canal After 9/11" and "New York Eviction Blues"). The collection also contains files related to Asian American Arts Centre and Asian American Dance Theatre/Asian Art Institute's grantsmanship, fundraising, and development, including grant proposals, foundation research, end-of-the-year fundraising form letters, etc. Many of the papers are the correspondence and notes of Robert Lee, one of the founders and the Executive Director of Asian American Arts Council, and Eleanor Yung, another Asian Amerian Arts Council founder and the artistic director of the former Asian American Dance Theatre. </p><p>To a lesser extent, the collection also includes materials generated by The Association of American Cultures and early Asian American movement organizations like Basement Workshop. The research files of Danny Yung, brother of Eleanor Yung, are also present, as are legal documents from the 26 Bowery case (Robert Lee and Eleanor Yung v. Tien Yick Co., Inc.). Some of the files pertain to Zuni Icosahedron, an experimental theater group from Hong Kong, of which Danny Yung is the artistic director.</p>  </scopecontent>
