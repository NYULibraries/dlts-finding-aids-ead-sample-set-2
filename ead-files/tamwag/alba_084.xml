      <p>Nusser, a volunteer, saw much combat, rising to be the commander of the First Company of the Lincoln Battalion. This collection includes "Give Me a Hero's Welcome Home," an undated, unpublished autobiographical typescript (127 pp), which recounts Nusser's Spanish Civil War experiences and several letters to "Mary" from Spain, as well as his passport stamped "not valid for travel in Spain." Other correspondence includes Nusser's 1986 exchange  with Spanish newspaper editors and local officials regarding his campaign to be awarded honorary Spanish citizenship and a signed note from Dolores Ibarruri to Nusser dated 9/5/86. Also, included is correspondence with Elizabeth de Leon, the niece of Michael Caldarella, a volunteer killed in Spain, with copies of letters from Spain to de Leon's mother. The collection also includes photographs, clippings and memorabilia from a veterans' trip to Spain in 1986; and an undated handwritten poem, "Valiant Section One."</p>
