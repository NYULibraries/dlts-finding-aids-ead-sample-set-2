      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry, Local 2 represented workers in the plumbing industry in Manhattan and the Bronx from the late 19th century until the late 1990s. The local was plagued by corruption, and in 1993, the national appointed a trustee to run the local.  In 1997, Local 2 was dissolved and its members placed into the jurisdiction of Local 1.</p>

      <p>Any rights (including copyright and related rights to publicity and privacy) held by the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry, Local 2, were transferred to New York University in 2001 by the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry, Local 2.

      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>One oversize folder was separated from this collection during initial processing and was established as a separate collection, the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry, Local 2 Photographs (PHOTOS 19). In 2014, the photograph collection was reincorporated into the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry, Local 2 Records.</p>
      <p>Other decisions regarding arrangement, description, and physical interventions for this collection prior to 2019 are unknown. In 2019, materials were rehoused in new acid-free folders and boxes with spacers in preparation for offsite storage. Original folders were retained when possible. If the original folder was kept, loose labels were stapled to ensure accurate titling and prevent loss of information. Where appropriate, materials were rehoused in archival folders and boxes. If present, original folder titles were used, with any descriptive enhancements by the archivist as necessary. Loose paper materials were placed in archival folders. The collection contained a folder of mold-damaged material. Preservation photocopies were made of mold-damaged materials if they were reproduced documents such as photocopies, otherwise they were treated for mold and retained. Water-damaged thermal fax materials were deaccessioned. Materials were described on the collection-level with a box list. Born-digital media (8 inch and 3 ½ floppies) were removed from their original locations using separation sheets and inventories, but have not yet been forensically imaged, analyzed, or described.</p>
      <p>New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content.</p>
