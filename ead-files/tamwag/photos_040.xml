      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Throughout her career, Betsy Wade has been an active trade unionist, serving as a shop steward, picket captain, and eventually as an officer in The Newspaper Guild, first as a Vice President of its International (1975-1981), and then, after winning bitterly contested elections on a dissident slate, two terms as President of the New York City-based Local 3 of the Guild (1978-1982). She was also a founder of the Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW), in 1974.</p>
      <p>Wade, an editor and writer, worked for the <title render="italic">New York Times</title>from 1956 to until her retirement in 2001. At the Times, she worked as copy editor on each of its three desks: local, national and foreign. She was chief of the foreign desk during the Vietnam War, as well as an assistant editor of the controversial Pentagon Papers during the same period. Wade was the first female head of the foreign copy desk at the Times. She was also among seven named plaintiffs in an influential successful sex discrimination case against the Times, which was settled out of court with an agreement to compensate the plaintiffs with back pay. Wade is occasionally referred to by her married name, Elizabeth Boylan (she married James Boylan, founder of <title render="italic">Columbia Journalism Review</title>).</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>Collection consists of 28 photographs (all but two are black and white), ranging from 2x3 to 8x10 prints, 24 photograph negatives, and two leaflets. The photographs include portraits of Betsy Wade and fellow-members of dissident factions that ran for offices in The Newspaper Guild, Local 3, picket lines and demonstrations (including some for the 1981 strike against the <title render="italic">New York Times</title>and participation by a delegation of Newspaper Guild members in the 1982 "No Nukes" New York City demonstration), and of a press conference with newspaper corporate executive Rupert Murdoch, labor arbitrator Theodore Kheel, and George McDonald (president of the Allied Printing Trades Council). Other individuals identified include (but are not limited to): Joy Cook, Frank Emblen, Eli Holtzman, Frank Mazza, and Betsy Wade. Some of the photographs were shot by Ruby Washington. The leaflets are election campaign publications for two dissident slates within The Newspaper Guild, Local 3--the "Responsibility Slate," 1978; and "The Membership Slate," 1980--both feature photographs and biographies of the candidates.</p>
