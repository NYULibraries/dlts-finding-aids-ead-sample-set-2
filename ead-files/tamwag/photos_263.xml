      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>This collection contains approximately 700 black and white and color photographs of the AFSCME Local 983. The bulk of the photographs date from 1998 to the mid 2000s. Most of the photographs are of rallies, conferences, meetings, and other events. Notable events include the rally against the police killing of Amadou Diallo, images relating to "workfare" program (a program requiring welfare recipients to work in exchange for benefits, often at jobs where the replaced or supplemented union workers), and the WEP (Work Experience Program) program. Many of the photographs feature Mark Rosenthal, the president of Local 983 from 1998 until the present day (2013 as of this writing.)</p>

      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>AFSCME (American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees), Local 983 is one of the District Council 37's earliest locals, founded in the 1950s. The union initially represented motor vehicle operators, but came to include different blue collar employees, including high pressure plant tenders, parks workers, asbestos handlers, assistant city highway repairers, city seasonal aides and other municipal and public employee jobs. Some historical highlights of the union included their two week strike in 1962, when 2,000 motor vehicle operators defied the anti-strike Condon-Wadlin Law. The strike achieved the first welfare fund for non-uniformed city employees and a wage and benefit increase that doubled the city's last offer before the walkout. In 1971, Local 983 was part of the 8,000 DC 37 worker walk out against Governor Nelson Rockefeller backed blocking of pension legislation. In 1998, Mark Rosenthal was elected president of Local 983.  In 2013, Joe Puleo was elected president of the local.</p>
