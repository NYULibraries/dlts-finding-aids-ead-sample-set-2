      <p>In October 2014, two boxes of duplicate or commercially released video material was de-accessioned. There are no longer boxes 40 and 41. At this time, Video Subseries A: Access Copes was altered to read Video Elements. Access copies are to be requested by the source material ID number. In 2015, 2018, and 2019, accretions were added to the collection as separate series in accordance with previous arrangement and description decisions. Original folder titles for these materials have been retained.</p>
      <p>Born-digital items from Series XII and XIII were physically separated and inventoried, forensically imaged, analyzed, and described.

          <p>Series IV consists of posters, programs, and flyers for various dance and arts performances and events. It largely consists of material related to New York City venues from the mid 1970s through the 1990s , but also includes other localities. Included in this series is material related to many notable New York City performance spaces and groups, including Danspace, Dance Theater Workshop LaMama, and Movement Research. Due to the nature of the type of material, many of the posters, programs and flyers do not include a year.</p>

Any additional material that was not assigned an original category has been arranged alphabetically by venue, and is listed at the end of the series.</p>

          <head>Scope and Content</head>
          <p>Oversize Series IV consists of oversize posters for various dance and arts performances and events. It largely consists of material related to New York City venues from the mid 1970s through the 1990s, but also includes other localities. Included in this series is material related to many noted New York City performance spaces and groups, including Danspace, Dance Theater Workshop, LaMama, and Movement Research. Due to the nature of the type of material, many of the posters do not include a year.</p>
