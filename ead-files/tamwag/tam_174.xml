    <abstract id="aspace_29f7a0f638e02003fe21b81a4ef5abfe">A number of national organizations were created in response to the Rosenberg and Sobell espionage cases in which Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted and sentenced to death and Morton Sobell was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Following the conviction of the Rosenbergs in 1951, the National Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case (NCSJRC) was formed. In the early 1970s Michael and Robert Meeropol, the Rosenberg's sons, sued the FBI under the Freedom of Information Act, and won the release of hundreds of thousands of previously secret documents pertaining to their parents' case.  The National Committee to Reopen the Rosenberg Case (NCRRC) was formed in conjunction with the proceedings of the suit. The NCRRC sought to exonerate the Rosenbergs, prove their innocence, and push for acknowledgement from the United States government that there had been a miscarriage of justice in the trial proceedings.

The collection contains materials spanning the years 1944-2005, with the bulk of material dating from 1974-1997. The majority of materials in the collection were created in the process of the outreach and publicity work that the organization did, and include correspondence and promotional materials. Promotional materials consist of research files (e.g. court transcripts, FOIA documents, newspaper clippings, and promotional materials from other organizations), article and newsletter drafts, newsletters, newsletter mock-ups, press releases, flyers, event programs and planning materials, pamphlets, booklets, photographic prints and negatives, and ads. Related to these promotional materials and research files are works and publications created in response to, or inspired by, the Rosenberg case. These include plays, an opera, music, manuscripts, theses, and books from writers, researchers, and students. These artistic and academic creations include manuscripts, bound materials, cassette tapes, audio CDs, vinyl records, and a VHS tape. To a lesser extent, there are administrative records such as meeting minutes, agendas, memos, event planning documents, fundraising reports, local committee finances, and financial reports.</abstract>

    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The National Committee to Reopen the Rosenberg Case Records is arranged into four series: </p><p>Series I. Administrative and Financial Records</p><p>Series II. Correspondence</p><p>Series III. Promotional Materials</p><p>Series IV. Archived Website</p><p>Regarding the arrangement of the collection, it should also be noted that the types of materials generated during the Committee's work are somewhat blurred across their activities. While there is a correspondence series with letters between the NCRRC and their supporters, sponsors and donors, committee members, local committees, institutions, and news outlets, correspondence is also a part of the the promotional materials series. Letter exchanges between the Committee and various stakeholders or political or social figures may be distributed through the NCRRC's newsletter. Some folders between series are also titled similarly, but contain different types of material and were grouped by the Committee differently. A folder called "Jewish Currents" may exist in both Series II and Series III due to the different types of materials they contain and the different ways the NCRRC used that information. Local committees are similarly represented in the collection in both Series I and Series III due to the varying purposes of the materials collected by the organization - in Series I, to document the work that local committees are doing, and in Series III, to collect the instances of publicity that the local committees are getting in newspapers.</p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>In 2014, the archived website was added as a series. Between 2010 and 2011, the NCRRC changed their website URL. The first website was captured sporadically between 2009 and 2010, and the second website was captured semi-regularly between 2011 and 2014. Both websites are now defunct, and there are no longer any site crawls being run. </p><p>Decisions regarding arrangement, description, and physical interventions for this collection prior to processing in 2019 have not been recorded.</p><p>A survey was conducted of the collection materials prior to processing. There was some original order to the collection as a whole, as the larger half of the collection was foldered, labeled to some extent, and generally grouped in various and inconsistent ways. Some files were ordered by year, person, groups/organizations, topic, state, country, or event. With the types of documents and materials there are, several natural series emerged and include administrative materials, correspondence, and promotional materials. </p><p>During processing, original folders were retained when possible. Where appropriate, materials were rehoused in archival folders and boxes. If present, original folder titles were used, with any descriptive enhancements by the archivist as necessary. Loose paper materials were placed in archival folders with descriptive titles by the archivist. Empty folders were discarded. An audiocassette tape was rehoused in an archival case. Preservation photocopies were made of original folders and kept with materials if the folders were not retained. Preservation photocopies were made of mold-damaged materials if they were reproduced documents such as photocopies and newspaper clippings or duplicated elsewhere in the collection. If the original folder was kept, loose labels were stapled to ensure accurate titling and prevent loss of information.</p>  </processinfo>

<p>Appraisal decisions made prior to 2019 are not documented. During processing in 2019, duplicates of newsletters, articles, newspaper clipping photocopies, and other distributable material were deaccessioned. Out-of-scope materials were also deaccessioned, such as the personal papers of the NCRRC's long-time director, Aaron Katz. Committee materials such as contribution and donation forms, tax documents, receipts and invoices, office lease documentation, job applications, and post office forms were deaccessioned. Extensive duplicates of Committee materials were also discarded.</p>  </appraisal>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>A number of national and local organizations were created in response to the Rosenberg and Sobell espionage cases in which Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted and sentenced to death, and Morton Sobell was sentenced to 30 years in prison. These national and local organizations engaged in community and political activism to defend, save, secure justice for, and secure clemency for the Rosenbergs. Following the conviction of the Rosenbergs and Sobell in 1951, the journalist William A. Reuben wrote a series of investigative articles for the <emph render="underline">National Guardian</emph>, and was involved in the formation of the National Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case (NCSJRC) with David and Emily Alman. Their grassroots campaign focused on preventing the couple's execution. They organized mass protests, letter campaigns, clemency petitions, fundraisers for legal fees and child care for the Rosenberg's two young sons, and the creation and distribution of publications to present new evidence to raise questions about the legitimacy of the Rosenberg trial and death sentence.</p><p>The controversy surrounding the Rosenbergs' sentencing continued after their executions, and the grassroots campaigns of the 1950s underwent several transformations. Some groups shifted their focus to Morton Sobell, the other defendant in the case. In 1973, the Rosenbergs' two sons, Michael and Robert Meeropol, continued the work of the NCSJRC, forming the National Committee to Reopen the Rosenberg Case (NCRRC). A major initial focus of the organization was the release, under the Freedom of Information Act, of the FBI files on the Rosenbergs. The Meeropols sued the FBI and in 1975 won the release of hundreds of thousands of previously secret documents pertaining to their parents' case.  The NCRRC sought to exonerate Julius and Ethel from the charge of atomic espionage and prove their innocence, and push for recognition from the United States government that the judicial system had not given the Rosenbergs due process. From the mid-1970s to the early 2000s, the NCRRC continued to seek an official review of the Rosenberg case and the exoneration of the couple through outreach and publicity campaigns and events.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection contains materials spanning the years 1944-2005, with the bulk of material dating from 1974-1997. The vast majority of materials in the collection were created in the process of outreach and publicity work, and include correspondence and promotional materials. To a lesser extent, there are administrative records such as meeting minutes, agendas, and memos; event planning documents; fundraising reports; local committee materials (including finance reports, correspondence, and promotional material); donor cards; and financial reports. A large chunk of the administrative materials pertain to the Carnegie Hall events coordinated by the Committee, primarily the 1974 event which kickstarted the efforts of the Committee. </p><p>Of the promotional materials, there are materials related to distributable printed matter such as newsletters, press releases, news bulletins, pamphlets and booklets, posters, buttons, event flyers and programs, advertisements, invitations, book reviews, speeches, a sermon, correspondence, and their respective drafts, mock-ups, and notes. There are also research files or collected materials used for the process of creating promotional materials. These include materials such as court transcripts, FOIA documents, newspaper clippings, correspondence, newsletters and promotional materials from other organizations, transcripts of public appearances, interview transcripts, photographic prints, photographic negatives, and copies of website text. Related to these promotional materials and research files are works and publications created in response to, or inspired by, the Rosenberg case. These include plays, an opera, music, manuscripts, theses, poems, and books from writers, researchers, and students. These artistic and academic creations include manuscripts, bound materials, cassette tapes, audio CDs, vinyl records, and a VHS tape. </p>  </scopecontent>

Documents supporting this promotional work also include newspaper clippings, research files, and correspondence. Some of the research files in this series include court transcripts, FOIA documents, newspaper clippings, and promotional materials from other organizations. Related to these promotional materials and their research files are works and publications created in response to, or inspired by, the Rosenberg case. Some of these include plays, an opera, music, manuscripts, theses, and books from writers, researchers, and students, and are primarily on paper or as bound materials, but also include audiovisual material such as audiocassette tapes, CDs, vinyl records, and a VHS tape.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_231876f20dc6bd97064868404c6e0084" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pamphlets and

Both iterations of the website contain extensive background information, photographs, and resources on the trial, the events surrounding it, and the people and players involved. The websites also include news updates and publicity on the work of the committee, contact information, and information on how to donate and take action. Some of the later captures from 2013 and 2014 contain Flash components that may not run. </p></scopecontent></c></dsc>
