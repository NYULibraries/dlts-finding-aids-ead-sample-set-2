      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Solon De Leon was born in New York City on September 2, 1883. He was the son of Daniel De Leon, Marxist theoretician and leader of the Socialist Labor Party (SLP). Although his parents were Jewish, he was unaware of this until he was an adult. He graduated from City College in 1902 and after working in Connecticut as a carpenter, house painter, and teacher, he returned to New York in 1905 to work on the SLP publications Daily People and Weekly People as a reporter, re-write man, and assistant editor. He translated "The Sword of Honor, or the Foundation of the French Revolution" by Eugene Sue and "Patriotism and the Worker" by Gustave Herve for publication by the SLP publishing house, New York Labor News Company. De Leon received an MA in economics from Columbia University in 1912 and a social work degree from the New School of Social Work (then the New York School of Philanthropy) in 1913. He was employed by the American Association for Labor Legislation as a field investigator, writer, and researcher, 1912-1920, while continuing to contribute to SLP publications under the pseudonym, Braset Marteau, but became politically and personally estranged from his father and from the SLP and was expelled from the Party in 1918. </p>
      <p>He was briefly a member of the Socialist Party of America, joining the Workers' Council group that became part of the Communist party in 1920. De Leon contributed to and helped to edit the Advance, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America's newspaper, 1919-1922; was director of the labor research department, Rand School of Social Science, during the 1920s, and edited the American Labor Year Book published by the Rand School. During the 1930s, he taught science and shop at the Walden School, a private progressive school in New York; was a nature and shop counselor at children's summer camps, and, as Bert Grant, wrote a science and nature column for the New Pioneer. From 1943 to 1964 De Leon was assistant research director for the National Maritime Union. He was also active in the Labor Research Association during the 1960s, and was a regular contributor of articles and book reviews to its publication Economic Notes. De Leon was a librarian and French instructor at Kettrell Junior College, a Black college in North Carolina from 1965 to 1967, and died in Ellenville, N.Y., on December 3, 1975.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The collection contains correspondence, essays, and fragmentary writings, both handwritten and typed, many touching upon union organization, and the politics and ideology of the American Left. Of special interest is his correspondence (between 1912 and 1914) with Daniel De Leon, Arnold Petersen, and other members of the Socialist Labor Party that capture the ideological conflicts that eventually led to De Leon's estrangement from his father and the Party. Correspondence from 1956-1965 between De Leon and League for Industrial Democracy members including Sidney Henchberg, Harry Laidler, Andrew Shiffrin, and Norman Thomas reflects De Leon's disenchantment with the League's lack of organizational activism. Bitter correspondence from 1964-1965 between De Leon and the president's office of The National Marine Union concerns the abolition of De Leon's position of assistant research director.</p>
      <p>Printed materials include flyers, brochures, pamphlets, and arbitration briefs from various labor unions and political organizations, as well as syllabi for courses taught by De Leon and fellow socialists for workers. There is a great deal of material of a personal nature also contained in the collection, consisting of personal and collected poetry, political drama, a scrapbook, a postcard collection, and several job applications for research and civil service work. In addition, materials with references to De Leon consisting of newspaper clippings from The Daily and Weekly People, a political essay, and correspondence between De Leon and members of the Socialist Labor Party and one of its principal leaders, his father Daniel De Leon, have been taken from the Nelson Frank collection and added as an addendum. </p>
      <p>An additional box of materials was added to the collection in 2015. These documents consist of correspondence and papers predominantly related to Solon De Leon's participation in labor organizing and education between 1920 and 1980. They also include a number of teaching materials for De Leon's courses in labor research and manuscripts for labor related plays and sketches.</p>

          <p>Research and Writings, consists of a potpourri of personal essays, book reviews, research inquiries, and speeches that span nearly a fifty year period. Of perhaps the most interest is De Leon's 1974 credo of atheism; his 1925 one act musical drama presented at The League for Industrial Democracy conference; his book review of Robert Hoxie's Trade Unionism in the United States (undated); and his 1926 speech to The League for Industrial Democracy entitled "Communism in the USA."</p>

The League for Industrial Democracy materials consist of form letters, ballots, flyers, reports, and pamphlets from 1955 1958, while The Southern Conference Educational Fund materials consist of speech transcripts, form letters, minority caucus resolutions, policy committee report positions, and a newspaper (the Southern Patriot) from the years 1973 1975 that chronicle internal political disputes over party ideology and strategy. Also included is correspondence from 1956 1965 between De Leon and League for Industrial Democracy members including Sidney Henchberg, Harry Laidler, Andre Shifften, and Norman Thomas that focus upon De Leon's disenchantment with the League's lack of organizational activism as well as a 1974 letter to Ann Braden and Penny Lane of The Southern Conference Education Fund.</p>
