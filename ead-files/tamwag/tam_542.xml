    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Howard Zinn (1922-2010) was an award-winning historian, activist, playwright, teacher, public speaker and author of articles, essays and books including the best-selling <emph render="italic">A People's History of the United States</emph>. Praised for his moral courage and passion for social justice, Zinn influenced thousands of students during a teaching career of more than thirty years.  Reaching the wider public through his books, plays, articles, lectures and in theatrical and television presentations of his <emph render="italic">Voices of A People's History</emph> and <emph render="italic">The People Speak</emph>, Zinn celebrated the lives of ordinary individuals engaged in the struggle for peace and justice, highlighting their often overlooked victories, and encouraging his audiences to engage as well.</p><p>Born on August 24, 1922, Howard Zinn was one of four sons of working-class Jewish immigrants Edward and Jennie (Rabinowitz) Zinn.  Growing up in Brooklyn, he held after school and summer jobs from the age of fourteen, graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School, and worked as an apprentice ship fitter at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. In early 1943, he joined the Army Air Corps, attaining the rank of Second Lieutenant. He trained as a bombardier and flew both combat and humanitarian missions in Europe.  In 1944 he married Roslyn Shechter and, after the war, they lived in public housing and began raising a family while he attended New York University on the GI Bill and worked at a variety of menial jobs.  Earning an undergraduate degree from NYU in 1951, Zinn continued his education at Columbia University, completing his MA in 1952 and PhD in 1958.  In 1960-1961, he was a post-doctoral fellow in East Asian Studies at Harvard University.</p><p>After part-time lecturing in history and political science (1953-1956) at Upsala College in New Jersey, Zinn accepted a position at Spelman College in Atlanta as Chairman of the Department of History and Social Sciences (1956). During his seven years at Spelman, an all-black women's college, he became deeply involved in the civil rights movement – mentoring student activists, participating in sit-ins and other actions, advising the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and producing articles for publications such as <emph render="italic">The Nation</emph> and <emph render="italic">Harper's</emph>.  His activism made him unpopular with the school's administration and, in 1963, he was dismissed.  Forty-one years later, in 2005, Zinn was invited to give Spelman's commencement address and the school awarded him an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters.</p><p>In 1964 Zinn published two books focusing on the civil rights movement – <emph render="italic">SNCC: The New Abolitionists</emph> and <emph render="italic">The Southern Mystique</emph>—and also accepted a teaching position at Boston University.  </p><p>His 24 years at BU were marked by overbooked classes and clashes with the administration, as well as teach-ins, strikes, debates, rallies and the writing of many articles, essays and books including two of particular note – <emph render="italic">Vietnam: The Logic of Withdrawal</emph> (1967), one of the first to strongly condemn US actions in Vietnam, and <emph render="italic">A People's History of the Unites States</emph> (1980), his most popular work.  Noam Chomsky describes this as "his enduring masterpiece", a book that communicates Zinn's "fundamental message about the crucial role of the people who remain unknown in carrying forward the endless struggle for peace and justice…"</p><p>Howard Zinn retired from Boston University in 1988.  His relatively early retirement allowed him to concentrate on speaking and writing and to continue participating in demonstrations, protests, strikes and acts of civil disobedience which, on some occasions, resulted in his arrest.  He spoke out against capital punishment and for improved prison conditions, expressed strong concerns about the environment and nuclear issues, consistently criticized US foreign policy in Central America and elsewhere, and was strongly opposed to the invasion and occupation of Iraq. </p><p>In 2002, Harper Collins celebrated the sale of one million copies of <emph render="italic">A People's History of the United States</emph> with a New York City performance of readings based on the book.  This was followed in 2004 by publication of <emph render="italic">Voices of a People's History of the United States</emph> in which Zinn and Anthony Arnove collected speeches, articles, essays, poetry and song lyrics by the individuals described in <emph render="italic">A People's History</emph>.  Public performances of selections from <emph render="italic">Voices </emph>culminated in the production of a feature film, <emph render="italic">The People Speak</emph>, in 2009.  The film features Zinn, along with well-known entertainers such as Matt Damon, Morgan Freeman, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Viggo Mortensen, Marisa Tomei, Josh Brolin and Danny Glover.  These performances, as well as references to Zinn in popular culture, including a mention in the 1997 film <emph render="italic">Good Will Hunting</emph>, significantly increased the number of his readers and viewers.  In 2008, the nonprofit Zinn Education Project was established to provide teaching materials based on Zinn's work to educators at the secondary school level insuring that his views on history, politics and social justice would continue to be introduced to young audiences.</p><p>Howard Zinn died on January 27, 2010.  He and his wife Roslyn, who died in 2008, had two children, Myla Kabat-Zinn and Jeff Zinn, and five grandchildren.  Zinn's life and work are described in his 1995 autobiography <emph render="italic">You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train</emph> which was released in 2004 as a documentary film of the same name.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information Note</head>
<p>No original order was apparent in the collection upon receipt.  Ten linear feet of manuscript material had been in the possession of Boston University (BU) and items had been placed in new folders, many titled "Professional Material: Research Files" with, in some cases, what appear to have been the original folder titles appended.  Four linear feet of audio/visual material had also been held by BU and was inventoried but not arranged in any order. One additional box contained editor's proofs of several of Zinn's books. The rest of the material came from the family in three deliveries.  Within a few of the boxes, there appears to have been a somewhat alphabetic arrangement but folders with the same or similar titles were found across the entire collection. Not all of the material was contained within folders.</p><p>A series arrangement was imposed by the archivist based on aggregation of materials with similar titles and content while keeping in mind the activities and interests of Howard Zinn (e.g. teaching, writing, speaking engagements) and the various types of material (e.g. books, audio/visual items) within the collection.  Description was based on original folder titles to the extent possible.  Because Zinn made many notes and annotations, his original folders were often photocopied and included within the new ones.  </p><p>In 2014, the archived website was added as Series XI. New York University Libraries follows professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity of the content. </p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>This collection provides a broad view of Howard Zinn's many activities and interests.  Among his personal papers are school and military records, datebooks, biographical articles and interviews.  Correspondence with a wide variety of individuals forms a large part of the collection.  There are also published and unpublished writings; drafts, fragments and corrected typescripts; datebooks and notebooks; research materials and lecture notes; posters, photographs and transparencies; annotated books, publications of many kinds, and audio and video materials documenting lectures, interviews, discussions, readings and other public events in which Zinn took part. </p><p>Correspondence is found in almost every series. The correspondence included in "Series II: Correspondence" is the most varied, containing letters, emails, postcards and related materials that Zinn had consolidated and arranged by year. Letters in "Series I: Personal and Biographical Material" involve family and close friends, and are personal in nature, while within "Series III: Writings", much of the correspondence reflects communication with publishers, editors, actors and others involved in his various projects.  Zinn associated the remaining correspondence with specific topics, individuals, events or issues being addressed and that arrangement has been maintained.   </p><p>Howard Zinn's extensive travels outside the United States are reflected in many parts of the collection.  In addition to material in "Series VII: Vietnam War" describing his visits to Vietnam, Paris and Japan, there are a number of folders in "Series VIII: Subject Files" containing publications, clippings and notes from his 1982 visit to South Africa as well as a copy of the speech he gave in Cape Town in "Series III: Writings."  He made a number of trips to Paris (1974, 1978, 1984) where he was a visiting professor at the University of Paris (Vincennes and Institut Charles Civiq) and to Italy as a Fulbright Distinguished Professor at the University of Bologna (1995).  Personal correspondence and memorabilia from these and other European travels, as well as from his South African visit and several trips to Cuba, may be found in "Series I: Personal and Biographical Material."  </p><p>There are many articles and newspaper clippings throughout the collection. It should be noted that he often clipped only the portions of articles that interested him, sometimes saving an initial section and not the continuation. The name of the publication and date of the article were not always saved.</p><p>The collection also contains Zinn's archived website, first captured in March 2009.  In addition to a biography and bibliography, the site contains print interviews, essays and commentary, audio and video, and information about The People Speak, the documentary based on the live performances of Howard Zinn and Anthony Arnove's Voices of a People's History of the United States.</p>  </scopecontent>

Among its highlights are school and military records, photographs, datebooks (1967-2008) and trip memorabilia.  </p><p>Personal correspondence includes  letters from family members and friends; Daniel and Philip Berrigan, Kurt Vonnegut and Alice Walker are among the more well-known. In addition, there is correspondence and related material that describes Zinn's dismissal from Spelman College as well as letters of support and good wishes on his retirement from Boston University.  One folder within this series contains recipes that had been clipped by Zinn and were found here and there within the collection.</p><p>Several folders contain portions of the Federal Bureau of Investigation file maintained on Howard Zinn beginning in 1949 (File # 100-30217).

Note</head><p>Spanning almost fifty years, Series II contains a wide variety of correspondence from strangers, acquaintances, colleagues and publishers.  Much of the material could be classified as fan mail although there are critical letters as well.  Many of the correspondents are involved in progressive causes championed by Zinn and the letters often reflect the personal experiences of those for whom Zinn's writings resonate.  There are also requests for job or school references as well as letters asking for Zinn's participation in a variety of events and projects.  Some of the correspondence is neither to nor from Zinn, but appears to have been shared with him by others.  </p><p>Zinn's annotations appear on some of the material and there are retained copies of a few of his responses. In a good number of instances, related items are included with the incoming letters (e.g., articles, reviews, clippings). Some well-known persons may be found within this series.  Examples include Bill Moyers, Pete Seeger, Herbert Aptheker, Eqbal Ahmad and Noam Chomsky.</p><p>In addition to general correspondence, the series also contains two specific groups of letters. The first, reflecting Zinn's interest in justice and the rights of the incarcerated, consists of correspondence with prisoners; some are well-known, such as  Kathy Boudin and Mumia Abu-Jamal.   The second group of letters involves students, many  at the secondary school level.  A number of teachers either introduced Zinn writings in their class or invited him to visit and speak to the students.

Book and screenplay proposals, album liner notes, letters to the editor, eulogies and special reports are also addressed.</p><p>There is a copy of his doctoral dissertation, "Conscience of the Jazz Age: La Guardia in Congress", along with a personal hand-written card from Mrs. Marie LaGuardia.  Of particular interest is a 767-page typescript of <emph render="italic">A People's History of the United States</emph>, with corrections, revisions and paste-over insertions in Zinn's hand.  Similar editor's proof versions of <emph render="italic">The Politics of History</emph> and <emph render="italic">You Can't be Neutral on a Moving Train</emph> are also included.

Note</head><p>The first Boston University (BU) subseries focuses on Howard Zinn's teaching career including course syllabi, a few lecture transcripts, a number of his annual appointment forms and student evaluations of his teaching for the years 1969 through 1983.  There are many examples of student work – papers, projects, journals and independent study – and a good deal of associated materials. The student journals not only provide a glimpse into the conduct of Zinn's classes and the materials he used, but also reveal reactions of the individual students.</p><p>The second, and much larger subseries, documents many crises and controversies that occurred during Zinn's time at BU including suppression of academic freedom and civil liberties, censorship of campus press, attempts to build and strengthen the AAUP and other unions on campus, tenure and salary grievances, strikes and demonstrations, issues surrounding various University trustees and many examples of the rancor between Zinn and John Silber, former BU president. Some of the conflicts continue even after Zinn's retirement, including his active opposition to Silber's gubernatorial candidacy in 1990.  It should be noted that material concerning specific controversies may be found in multiple folders.  An event might, for example, appear in a general controversies folder, in a folder focused on the Committee to Save Boston University, in a folder addressing AAUP activities and in a folder titled with the name of the particular issue. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref545" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries V:A: Teaching and Student Material</unittitle><unitdate normal="1964/2003"

Of particular interest are his travels to various anti-war conferences in Japan in 1966 and to Vietnam in 1968 and 1972, especially his Hanoi trip with Rev. Daniel Berrigan to receive prisoners released by the North Vietnamese. This is a large series with many articles, clippings, notebooks, photographs and publications. Materials extend through 2001 documenting post-war activities and influences. </p><p>A smaller subseries contains items relating to the release of the Pentagon Papers and Zinn's involvement with Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo, including copies of court documents, hearing transcripts, and the Gravel Edition of <emph render="italic">The Pentagon Papers</emph>.</p></scopecontent><c

Some of the largest subject areas are the Gulf Wars, Central America, the Central Intelligence Agency, civil liberties, crime and punishment, East Asia (especially China), prisons, terrorism and trials  (including many at which Zinn provided testimony).  There are many folders which Zinn labeled either "Hope" or "Resistance"; they contain collected articles, clippings, flyers, notes and individual documents describing various events or acts of resistance which appeared to him to be reasons for hope and optimism.  </p><p>Some of the materials in this series, particularly newspaper clippings, are in poor condition. Also, because Zinn's method of clipping articles sometimes meant merely saving the portion of interest to him, many pieces are incomplete and may lack publication title and/or date.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1066" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abortion (Zinn notes)</unittitle><unitid>cuid16319</unitid><unitdate>undated</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton"
