      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>Founded in 1982 by Louis P. Maletta, the Gay Cable Network was the premiere chronicler of major events and personalities of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community for nearly two decades. Broadcast on public access television in New York City and other major cities worldwide, GCN covered key LGBT civil rights battles, five presidential conventions, as well as the AIDS pandemic and social protests often marginalized in the mainstream media. On televised programs like Gay USA, Pride and Progress, The Right Stuff, Men and Films, Candied Camera, In the Dungeon, and Lavender Health, GCN conducted numerous interviews with leading politicians, medical and educational professionals, entertainers, and social activists.</p>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Under the direction of Lou Maletta, and broadcast on Manhattan Cable Television Channel 35, Gay Cable Network (GCN) began in 1982 and stopped production in 2001. GCN was the first network in the nation to openly appeal to a gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender audience. GCN initially broadcast a series titled "Men in Films," which explored the gay male image in media and male erotica, and the network soon evolved to host a wider variety of content, including news and current affairs programs which covered political developments affecting the LGBT community and the AIDS/HIV epidemic. Throughout its time, GCN provided coverage of the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, with on-floor correspondents interviewing candidates and delegates, as well as coverage of the 1987 and 1993 LGBT rights marches on Washington. A documentary aired on GCN, "Out in the 90's," earned the network a Special Recognition Award at the inaugural GLAAD Media Awards in 1990.</p>

              <p>1. Andy Humm talks about how most of the previous night's show was not broadcast because the tape was jammed, which means most of this episode is actually a repeat of the last one.</p>
              <p>2. Top story on how someone spray-painted 'O'CONNOR SPREADS DEATH' on Cardinal O'Connor's Madison Avenue residence.  Three people nearby were arrested, 'roughed up', and verbally abused by police. David Meirian's footage from segment 6 of 0285 is repeated. Humm interviews Lori Cohen, an attorney (also part of ACT UP) on the rash of police brutality. Scott Sensenig is mentioned, with a cutaway to his photo in the Village Voice where he has 'two black eyes and a five-inch gash across his forehead'. Graffiti artist Michael Griffith is mentioned. The two discuss the North Precinct incident; Cohen states that the deputy commissioner got paint on his new shoes, and in retaliation sent his police to attack the crowd. One of the only arrests was someone who was videotaping the event. Chris Henley, who suffered a debilitating concussion during the scuffle, is planning to sue the police. Cohen discusses how there has been no response from any level of government or police on the issue. Humm mentions a March 3rd demonstration in Times Square. There is talk about how Manhattan North has always had a bad reputation with gays and lesbians. Humm is then joined by Matt Foreman from the Anti-Violence Project. Foreman talks about how three escort services have recently robbed people. Foreman advises people use word of mouth, and only go with services that use credit cards instead of cash-only. Foreman then discusses that there is an anti-activist feeling among police and an increased militarism because of the recent Gulf War. Cohen talks about how most of the charges against the demonstrators will most likely be dropped because there's little evidence. Foreman talks about being 'weary' of going to demonstrations because he believes he will at some point be targeted by police.</p>

              <p>3. Andy Humm talks about domestic partnerships in San Francisco, and that rights groups are trying to get the same thing done in New York.</p>

              <p>NOTE: This particular tape is very unusual. It is clearly not a finished broadcast, instead its segments from the earlier 231 0340 video. It is only 30 minutes long and there are no commercials. </p>
              <p>The tape begins suddenly with a shot from inside a car where one can hear two people talking, one of whom is (presumably) Lou Maletta. There is static, and the video then cuts to a speech about the exclusion of gays from the St. Patrick's Day Parade. The video cuts to black about four minutes into the speech, then cuts back to an interview already in progress.</p>
              <p>The rest of the tape seems to be a rough cut of 231 0340; the same interviews appear.</p>

Maletta and the team cover the Republicans support of abstinence-only education and criminal prosecution for 'anyone who knowingly[â¦]transmit[s] the AIDS virus.' Republican party statements on AIDS prevention are displayed on-screen, including 'We reject the notion that the distribution of clean needles and condoms are the solution to stopping the spread of AIDS.', and stresses 'marital fidelity, abstinence, and a drug-free lifestyle.' The statement also lauds the Boy Scouts of America for 'defending decency' and calls for the disbanding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The final statement: "Unlike the Democratic party and its candidate, we support the continued exclusion of homosexuals from the military as a matter of good order and discipline."</p>

It tore that family apart as it always does." Dornan states that gay men in the military would do nothing but have sex with each other and destroy morale. Dornan states that monogamous gay relationships don't exist. Elanor Van Middlesworth, a delegate, is interviewed and states that gays and lesbians should not have equal rights and should instead 'control themselves'. "I don't like to say gay, I like to say homosexual." Van Middlesworth also makes bizarre statements about the Cracker Barrel controversy that gays should not 'handle food' because customers might get AIDS. Michael Undseth, a delegate, is asked what he would do if his son came out to him: "He wouldn't. Because he's not." Undseth states that people choose to be gay and that all people are born heterosexual, and that gays 'recruit'. He recommends counseling and psychotherapy to 'cure' gays. A group of young Republicans happily chant "Burn the log cabin!" A young Republican states "We do not include special rights." Frank Ricchiazzi, a log cabin delegate is interviewed. </p>
