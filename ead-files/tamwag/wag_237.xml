    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The MMPU, established in 1863, was the first organization that could be classified as a trade union for musicians.  This collection documents the nineteenth-century activities of New York City's organized musicians.  Musicians organized for better wages and working conditions, supported each other's welfare, and attempted to regulate their employment in a constantly fluctuating job market.  The collection contains two volumes each of Executive Committee/Board of Directors minutes, 1863-1878, and Regular Meetings minutes, 1867-1905.  Also included are a book of minutes and accounts for the Pension Fund, 1900-1901, a finance ledger, 1870-1910, a few pocket-sized membership directories (1877, 1883, 1885, 1886, 1899, and 1904), and some constitutions and by-laws. </p><p><emph render="bold">The MMPU Minutes and ledger, 1863-1910 are also available on microfilm at the library (R-7437). Researchers should use microfilm for these items. </emph>
