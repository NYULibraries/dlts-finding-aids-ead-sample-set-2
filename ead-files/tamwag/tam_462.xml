      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>The Campaign for Peace and Democracy (founded in 1982 as Campaign for Peace and Democracy/East and West) is dedicated to advancing a progressive and non-militaristic U.S. foreign policy -- one that encourages democracy and social justice by promoting solidarity with activists and progressive movements throughout the world. The Campaign opposed the Cold War by calling for "detente from below," engaging Western peace activists in the defense of the rights of democratic dissidents in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and enlisted East-bloc human rights activists against U.S. policies in countries like Nicaragua and Chile. Along with the European Nuclear Disarmament Movement, the Campaign built grassroots solidarity across the Cold War divide, and refused to "choose sides" in the East-West conflict.</p>

          <p>The Campaign for Peace and Democracy, founded in 1982, works to advance a progressive and non-militaristic U.S. foreign policy and is opposition to current U.S. foreign policy. Orginally, the campaign engaged Western peace activists in the defense of the rights of democratic dissidents in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and enlisted East-bloc human rights activists against anti-democratic U.S. policies in countries like Nicaragua and Chile. The majority of the Campaign's work has been its efforts to work with dissidents and social justice movements worldwide, and to forge alliances between them and progressive movements in the United States. The website contains petitions, endorsements, action alerts, news analysis, and endorsements.</p>
