      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Julius J. Manson (1907-1988) was a New York City professor and labor mediator and arbitrator.  He received his JD from Brooklyn Law School in 1936 and his PhD in Economics from Columbia University in 1955.  In the 1930s, he worked as an investigator for the New York State Labor Department, Division of Women in Industry and Minimum Wage.  From the 1940s through the 1980s, Manson was a labor mediator for the New York State Board of Mediation.  He also served as the Board's Executive Director during 1957-1959. In 1966-1967, he lived in Ankara and worked as an advisor to the Turkish Government on Labor Relations.  Manson was a professor in the Department of Management at Baruch College during 1969-1977 and served as the Business School Dean in 1972-1974.  He held the title of professor emeritus after 1977.  He also taught labor studies courses at Columbia, New York University, the New School, and Cornell University.  Additionally, he founded and was chair of the Labor-Management Luncheon Series at the New School for Social Research in the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
      <p>Manson was involved with the international Esperanto movement, representing the Universal Esperanto Association of the United Nations in the 1980s and 1990s.  He was a founding member of the Three Arrows Cooperative Society and served as its president during 1937-1938.  His first wife, Minnie Kaplan, died in 1941.  After World War II, he married Elizabeth Robinson Butzner.</p>
