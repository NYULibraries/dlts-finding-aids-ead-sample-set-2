      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>June Nash is a social and feminist anthropologist and Distinguished Professor Emerita at the City University of New York (CUNY) who has written and conducted extensive field work throughout the United States and Latin America, especially in Bolivia, Mexico and Guatemala. She has also been a part of feminist and working class social movements such as the Mexican Zapatista Army of National Liberation. Her 1979 book <title render="italic">We Eat the Mines and the Mines Eat Us</title> details working conditions of Bolivian tin mines in the mid twentieth century. Nash's ethnography focuses on working-class mining community to better understand the connection between Bolivia's proletariat and indigenous classes, the basis for the labor solidarity movement in Bolivia, and the radicalism that was emerging in the country at the time.</p>
