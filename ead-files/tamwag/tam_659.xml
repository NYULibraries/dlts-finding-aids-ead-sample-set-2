    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p><title render="italic">Socialist Revolution</title> (changed to <title render="italic">Socialist Review</title>) was a left wing periodical established in San Francisco in 1970 as a voice for socialist discourse. The magazine addressed issues of feminism, gender and sexuality, international affairs, social justice, political and economic systems, cultural theory, and postmodern critical theory. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, the magazine was associated with the New American Movement and its politics shifted toward a more Social Democratic perspective. In 1978, the magazine was renamed <title render="italic">Socialist Review</title> when the publication absorbed the serial <title render="italic">Marxist Perspectives</title>. In 2002 the magazine's name changed again to <title>Radical Society: A Review of Culture and Politics</title> and from 2002 to 2003 was published by Routledge. In 2006 independent publisher Radical Society Ltd., took over publishing and relaunched Radical Society's website.</p><p>Prominent intellectuals who contributed to the journal or participated in its editorial board included: Robert Allan, Debra Chasnoff, Dan Brook, Nancy Chodorow, Noam Chomsky, Gary Delgado, Kate Ellis, Barbara Epstein, Jeffrey Escoffier, Herbert Gintis, Carol Hatch, Dorothy Healey, Michael Kazin, Karl E.
