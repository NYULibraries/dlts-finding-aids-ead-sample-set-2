    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>At the time of accessioning, materials were placed into new acid-free folders and record boxes due to the presence of pests, and a collection-level record was created. Original folder titles were retained and transcribed. A related collection documenting exclusively La Botz's 2010 campaign for US Senate [TAM.565] was donated by La Botz in two gifts in 2011 and 2013. This collection is governed by a different agreement and provides a broader scope of materials related to La Botz's life and activities, and is therefore a separate collection.</p>  </processinfo>
