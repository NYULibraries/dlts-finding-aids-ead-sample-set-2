    <abstract id="aspace_6769bd4fb41b2d4a573ec62a9736adb6">Gil Green (1906-1997) was a Communist, a Smith Act defendant, and a prominent figure in the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) through 1991. As a youth, he joined the Young Workers League (later the Young Communist League) eventually becoming its national secretary. From 1941-1945 and again from 1966-1968, Green was head of the Communist Party in New York State and also briefly headed the Party in Illinois. Convicted under the Smith Act in 1949, Green was imprisoned from 1956 until 1961. He left the Party in 1991 and helped to found the Committees of Correspondence. The Gil Green Papers date from 1949 to 1993 and include Green's correspondence, writings, and documentation of his political activities. The collection also contains a large amount of FBI files obtained by Green through Freedom of Information Act requests. These files relate primarily to the FBI's investigations of Green's work with the CPUSA and his prosecution under the Smith Act.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Gil Green (1906-1997), born Gilbert Greenberg in Chicago, the son of working class Russian-Jewish immigrants, was a Communist youth leader in the 1930s, a member of the Communist Party's Politburo, a Smith Act defendant, and the chief figure of a reformist current in the CPUSA through 1991. Green joined the Young Workers League (later the Young Communist League) in 1924, and shortly thereafter, the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA). He rose through the ranks, and in 1932 became national secretary of the YCL, a position he held throughout the decade. As secretary of the YCL he trained a generation of Party cadres and led the League to a position of influence in the 1.7 million-member American Youth Congress. In 1935 he attended the Comintern's Seventh Congress, where he was an advocate for the emerging Popular Front policy. In 1941 Green became head of the Party in New York State, but relinquished the title in 1945 due to his association with ousted Party head Earl Browder. Green later  moved to Chicago where he headed the Illinois Party organization. Convicted under the Smith Act in 1949, Green became a fugitive, surrendered in 1956 and was released from jail in 1961. In 1966, Green once again became the head of the New York Party, but resigned in 1968 to protest the CPUSA's endorsement of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. He remained an elder statesman and locus of Communist Party reform currents until 1991, when he left the Party and helped to found the Committees of Correspondence, a social-democratic organization. </p><p>Works by Gil Green:</p><p><list><item><title render="italic">Marxism and the world today.</title>New York : New York State Committee, Communist Party, n.d. 23 p.</item><item><title render="italic">Youth confronts the Blue Eagle.</title>New York : Youth Publishers, November, 1933. 29 p.</item><item><title render="italic">United we stand : for peace and socialism.</title>New York : Workers Library Publishers, 1935. 63 p.</item><item><title render="italic">Young Communists and the unity of youth.</title>Speech delivered at the 7th World Congress of the Communist International.

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Gil Green Papers date from 1941 to 1993 and contain the correspondence, writings, and FBI files of Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) leader and organizer Gil Green. His papers consist primarily of correspondence and FBI files released through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Green corresponded with many like-minded communists, ex-communists, other U.S. leftists, historians, and researchers, and much of the correspondence in this collection relates to communist history and radical thought and activity. Several letters relate to Green's support of the Puerto Rican independence movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s. There is a small amount of personal correspondence between Green and his family, including photocopies of Green's correspondence during his five years in prison, 1956-1961. Green's prison correspondence largely consists of letters to his first wife (Lil Green, 1910-1964) and children, but also contains some letters with political associates and attorneys. The collection includes an assortment of unpublished typescripts, notes, and other materials related to Green's political career. Green's writing consist of speeches at Communist Party engagements, political essays and editorials, unpublished typescripts of books by Green and others, and several documents related to the publicity and reception of Green's books. A number of the FBI files in this collection were used by Green in preparation for his memoir, <emph render="italic">Cold War Fugitive</emph>, and were grouped by Green to facilitate his research. Green's FBI files make up the bulk of his collection and document government surveillance of his political activities from the late 1930s through the 1970s. The majority of these files focus on Green's affiliation with the CPUSA, the FBI's hunt for Green between 1949 and 1956, and his prison sentence. FBI files are accompanied by correspondence between Green, his attorney Edward Greer, and federal agencies regarding FOIA requests.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>This collection was originally arranged into 5 series. In 2016, materials in Series I through Series III were consolidated and series numbers were updated to reflect this change.</p><p>Previously unprocessed materials in Series IV: FBI and Prison Files were processed in 2016. With the exception of a small portion of documents arranged by Green for personal research, these files had not been arranged. Before sending these materials to Tamiment, Green removed thousands of pages labeled "FOIPA Deleted Information Sheets," to reduce bulk, but retained the rest of the files largely as he had received them from the FBI. Titles for these files have been supplied by the archivist based on the FBI's general topic of inquiry; however, topics vary widely within certain files.</p>  </processinfo>

Subseries IVC: Files By Topic, are grouped roughly by topic of investigation or FBI office of origin.</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_949026b0c58bf0053838a3c0c1497c38"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>This series makes up the bulk of the collection and contains all of the files sent to Gil Green from federal agencies between 1978 and 1991 in response to his numerous Freedom of Information Act requests. They consist of FBI reports, correspondence between bureau offices, transcripts of trial proceedings and testimony, surveillance logs, and copies of documents produced by individuals and organizations under FBI surveillance. A large portion of these files deal with the FBI's hunt for Green between 1951 and 1956. During these years, Green was a political fugitive seeking to escape federal charges for violating the Smith Act. The series also contains a number of FBI files obtained through the efforts of Gil Green's attorney, Edward Greer, and contain FBI files from various regional offices and files on individuals affiliated with Green or the CPUSA between the 1930s and 1970s. FBI files contained in Subseries IVB were grouped by Green in preparation for his 1984 memoir, <emph render="italic">Cold War Fugitive: A Personal Story of the McCarthy Years</emph>. These files are heavily annotated and reflect the various stages of the FBI's campaign against Green. They do not, however, correspond with chapters in his book.</p><p>Along with FBI files, Green received several hundred pages of documents from the Bureau of Prisons and Parole Board. These files contain copies of Green's personal notes and correspondence during his time in prison, as well as conduct reports, telephone logs, and parole board paperwork.</p><p>Also included among these materials is a small amount of correspondence between Green, his attorney Ed Greer, and various federal agencies regarding Green's FOIA requests between 1975 and 1981, held in Subseries IVA.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref121" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries IVA: FOIA Correspondence</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype

sent to Gil Green from the FBI as a result of his FOIA requests. These files range in size from ten to several hundred pages, and have been retained largely as they were received from the FBI. In some instances, certain pages have been excluded by the FBI. Where these exclusions occurred, the FBI included "FOIPA Deleted Information Sheets." Many sheets, however, were removed by Green to reduce bulk, and it may no longer be apparent where certain content has been omitted.</p><p>Files in this subseries were sent to Green from both national and regional FBI offices. They document a wide array of topics related to Green's political activities between the 1930s and 1970s, including: Smith Act trials against members of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA), the FBI's search for Green and other Smith Act fugitives, Green's surrender to the FBI, Green's five-year sentence at Leavenworth prison, and surveillance of Green after his release. The files contain a variety of documents including: FBI field reports, correspondence between bureau offices, Smith Act trial transcripts, surveillance logs, and copies of documents produced by individuals or organizations under FBI surveillance. Files from regional offices largely relate to CPUSA activities in New York and Chicago. A large portion of these regional files consist of memoranda from the Special Agents in Command (SAC), who managed the FBI regional offices, and contain records of the FBI's surveillance of Green. Other files focus on individuals or organizations associated with Green, but may not relate to him directly. These files touch on a wide array of topics. Titles for these files address the general subject to which they relate, but because some vary so widely, references to certain topics or individuals may be scattered throughout.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref154" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bureau of Prisons and Parole Board</unittitle><unitdate normal="1948/1980" type="inclusive">1948-1980</unitdate><container id="aspace_0750a0baad346060dfb13060c514d564" label="Mixed Materials [31142051727306]" type="box">8</container><container id="aspace_9a9e58fced74f793bc7781b6a093d802" parent="aspace_0750a0baad346060dfb13060c514d564" type="folder">3-11</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref155" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bureau of Prisons and Parole Board</unittitle><unitdate normal="1958/1961" type="inclusive">1958-1961</unitdate><container id="aspace_c462dbff7b020a44eb07afe7dd65ccdf" label="Mixed Materials [31142051727314]" type="box">9</container><container id="aspace_4ec1ea1ae16b94c3e2cb1f6b9bdd34a4" parent="aspace_c462dbff7b020a44eb07afe7dd65ccdf" type="folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref156" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chicago FBI Office Files -
