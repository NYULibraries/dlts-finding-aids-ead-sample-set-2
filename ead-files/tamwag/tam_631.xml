      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Marc Lendler graduated from Antioch College in 1970. During the 1960s, Lendler had been involved in student activism and following the break-up of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) he became a member of the Revolutionary Union (RU). The summer following his graduation Lendler joined the RU when he and 20 other Antioch students attended a meeting led by several RU national representatives. The meeting's participants were divided into groups and sent to Springfield, Dayton, and Cincinnati as well as some who stayed at Antioch. Lendler went to Cincinnati where he remained an active member in the RU, which later became the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP), from 1970 to 1979.</p>
      <p>During his involvement with the RU, Lendler was at times a member of local leadership and at others a regular member of the collective. He spent approximately three years in local leadership, at which time he was not employed. After that, however, he worked in several blue collar jobs, with the longest being at Diamond International paper plant.  While at Diamond, Lendler brought a case against the company to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and won. Several documents regarding this case are included in Lendler's collection.
Lendler was removed from leadership shortly before the RU became the RCP. One of the reasons he cites for his removal was his opposition to the RU's position on school busing. In 1979, Lendler participated in a demonstration against Teng Hsiao-ping in Washington where he was arrested and spent two days in jail, but was never indicted.</p>
      <p>Lendler left the RCP in October 1979, and stated that following the May Day demonstration of 1980, he no longer believed in the principles of the party. Two years later he moved to the East coast with his family, where he pursued graduate studies in political science. Lendler taught for four years at Bennington College, but was fired along with a third of the faculty as part of a controversial budgetary overhaul. He currently teaches American politics in the Government Department at Smith College. </p>
