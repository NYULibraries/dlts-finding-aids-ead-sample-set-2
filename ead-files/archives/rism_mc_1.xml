      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Carl Loraine Withers was born on March 20, 1900, the youngest of five children. His parents, Sarah Virginia Adams Withers and Horace Smith Withers, settled in a small rural community near Sheldon, Missouri. During his formative years, Withers' family experienced economic hardship. Nevertheless, in 1918 they managed to raise sufficient funds for Withers to travel to Harvard University where he successfuly passed the entrance exam and received conditional acceptance as an English major. For unknown reasons, Withers withdrew from Harvard a year later and for a brief period worked as a field-hand in Ely, Nevada. In 1920 he returned to Harvard to complete his studies and graduated magna cum laude in 1922.</p>
      <p>Following graduation, Carl Withers was associated with various academic institutions. In 1923 he taught English at Northwestern University followed by a brief teaching assignment at the College of William and Mary. In 1925 Withers was appointed director of the English Department at Deerfield Academy. He left the position after receiving a fellowship from the Scandinavian-American Foundation at the University of Copenhagen. Over the next two years he traveled and studied in Europe. When he returned to the U.S. in January 1927, he held two part-time teaching positions at New York University (Washington Square College) and the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
      <p>In 1929, Withers left academia to work as an editor for the Grolier Society in Kansas City, Kansas. This editorial position was the first of several positions he held with the company. While employed by Grolier, Withers acquired knowledge of anthropology through the influential works of A.L. Kroeber and Charles W. Wagley. In 1935 he enrolled in Columbia University's graduate anthropology program. Four years later he secured financial grants that enabled him to conduct a field study in Wheatland, Missouri. Following completion of the project in 1940, and prior to the publication of his findings, Withers resumed teaching at Brooklyn College. His findings were published in 1945 as <title render="italic">Plainville, U.S.A.</title> under the pseudonym James West.</p>
      <p>In 1947 Withers returned to the Grolier Society's New York office as an editor-in-chief. His major accomplishment during this period was the publication of a ten-volume reference work <title render="italic">Lands and Peoples, </title>specifically created for young adults. Withers' second major accomplishment that year involved a successful proposal to conduct field studies in Cuba. Under the auspices of the Viking Fund and the American Philosophical Society, he traveled to Cuba in the summer of 1948, visiting both Mayajigua, Los Villas, situated on the north central coast of Cuba, and Trinidad, a city in central Cuba noted for its colonial architecture.</p>
      <p>In the fall of 1948, Withers returned to the U.S. and accepted the position of Research Associate at Yale University's Department of Student Health. Working with Ralph Linton, his former graduate advisor at Columbia University, Withers organized studies focusing on the psychological stress experienced by undergraduates. The resulting publication, which Withers co-authored with Abram Kardiner, Ralph Linton, and Cora Du Bois, was published as <title render="italic">Psychological Frontiers of Society</title>.</p>
      <p>Between 1949 and 1950, Withers returned to Mayajigua and expanded his field studies to include several other regions. He returned to the U.S. in 1950, intent on organizing the Cuban materials for publication. However, in 1952, a grant from the American International Association allowed him to travel to Venezuela, where he taught vocational skills in select schools for a year. In 1953 Withers accepted the position of visiting professor at the University of Brazil. While there, he conducted a field study of Arraial do Cabo, a coastal fishing village, as part of field work training for the employees of the National Museum of Brazil.</p>
      <p>In 1956 Withers received a grant from the Research Institute for the Study of Man (RISM) to complete the Cuban manuscript, but after three years the work was still incomplete. In 1959 he accepted the position of Social Science Research Analyst at the Children's Bureau of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (DHEW). In September 1960, with the financial support of DHEW and additional grants from the Ford Foundation and RISM, Withers launched a pilot study on American teen culture in St. Louis, Missouri. Through an arrangement with DHEW, Withers served as a visiting professor at Washington University in Missouri for the length of the study.</p>
      <p>In the final years of his life, Carl Withers' long-standing interest in children's folklore dominated his time. His first book in the genre was the classic <title render="italic">Rocket in My Pocket</title>, published in 1948. By the mid-1960s 70,000 copies of the book had been sold.</p>
      <p>In 1969 Withers' health began to decline, prompting his decision to transfer the Cuban materials to RISM. He died of a stroke in his Greenwich Village home on January 5, 1970.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The Carl L. Withers Manuscript Collection chronicles Withers' fieldwork studies conducted in Cuba during the mid 20th century and includes correspondence, stenographic notebooks used for fieldwork entries, folklore, observations and research citations, print material, children's art work, poems and essays, unpublished manuscripts, photographs, maps, and ephemera.</p>
      <p>Major strengths of the collection include more than 1,000 black and white photographs, which offer a rare portrait of Cuba during the pre-Castro era. Although Withers documented his 1948 visits to Mayajigua (Los Villas) and Trinidad, as well as subsequent visits in 1949 and 1950 to Havana, it remains unclear when he visited Baracoa, Santiago, Camaguey and other regions where photographs were taken.</p>
      <p>There are also many challenges associated with the collection. Much of the correspondence is riddled with abbreviations and anthropological symbols, typical of Withers' handwriting. Many of the photographs lack identifying information. In addition, several of the photographs have been marred by Withers' handwritten notations.</p>
      <p>Unpublished manuscripts include fragile and brittle papers that have been photocopied for research purposes.</p>
      <p>The collection has benefited from a number of appended items that provide additional insight into Withers' life and particularly his working relationship with Dr. Vera D. Rubin and others. Culled from RISM's institutional files, these items include: 1) Withers' book proposal and outline for the Cuban study entitled <title render="italic">The Green Island: Life in a Cuban Town</title>, 2) select correspondence between Withers and Dr. Rubin concerning grants for the Cuban Study and the American Youth Culture Project, subsequently published as <title render="italic">Plainville U.S.A.</title>, and a book review, 3) samples of a survey used to collect children's folklore, 4) Carl Withers' bequest to the Research Institute for the Study of Man, 5) a memoir written by Frank Snowden Hopkins, which includes Xeroxed images of Withers, 6) an obituary published in the <title render="italic">American Anthropologist</title> in 1972, and 7) posthumous correspondence related to Withers' Cuban materials.</p>

          <p>Photographs arranged by region, group, and photo number. This series contains approximately 1044 black and white photos taken during Withers' field studies in Cuba between 1947 - 1950. It is organized into five subseries: Mayajigua, Trinidad , Baracoa, Camaguey, Habana and Havana, and scanned and unidentified photos. Withers' photo captions, identification of camera used, (i.e. Bantam BN), and numbering system were recorded on storage envelopes and are included below. Items that were present in Wither's numbering system but were missing from the collection are also listed. The envelopes have been placed at the end of each photo group. Added captions, photo numbers, clarification of symbols, and translation of some Spanish words and phrases appear in brackets.</p>

          <p>2.0 linear feet, arranged numerically. This series consists of several unpublished manuscripts that represent the compilation of folklore collected by Carl Withers in Cuba. The manuscripts are written in Spanish but extensively annotated in English. In his bequest to RISM, (see Appendix) Withers describes the manuscripts as follows: 1) the <title render="italic">Manolo Manuscript</title>, an "autobiographical and descriptive document, based on the life of Manuel Picabea, a hired informant." The original <title render="italic">Manolo Manuscript</title> consisted of 1,525 pages, but missing pages have been indicated in brackets. Indexed notes are also included. Withers' bequest also includes <title render="italic">The Life of Manolo</title> (242 pages) and <title render="italic">The World of Manolo</title> (1016 pages). These manuscripts were shorter versions of the <title render="italic">Manolo Manuscript</title> edited by Luis Ratinoff between 1958 and 1959. A fourth manuscript, <title render="italic">The World of A Cuban Nobody: A Study in Social Perception</title>, consists of four unnumbered sections. Researchers are asked to use preservation copies in boxes 15-17.</p>
