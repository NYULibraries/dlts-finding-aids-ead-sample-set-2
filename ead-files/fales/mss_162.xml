    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Brooks McNamara began teaching at NYU's Graduate Drama Department in 1968, and was instrumental in its transformation into the Performance Studies Department, which officially was started in 1980. He founded the Shubert Archives in 1976 and served as its Director for 20 years. McNamara's research, writing, and curatorial pursuits resulted in numerous publications, exhibitions, productions, and archival collections. His life work spanned the fields of theatre history, popular entertainments, public celebrations, and New York performance history. After retiring in 1996, McNamara remained Professor Emeritus of Performance Studies and Director Emeritus of the Shubert Archive. He died in May 2009.</p><p><emph render="bold">List of Selected Publications:</emph> </p><p><emph render="bold">Books:</emph> </p><p><emph render="italic">The New York Concert Saloon: the Devil's Own Nights.</emph> Cambridge, U.K.; New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002.</p><p><emph render="italic">Gower Champion Dance and American Musical Theatre.</emph> With David Payne-Carter and Stephen Nelson.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Brooks McNamara Papers reflect McNamara's life work as a scholar and professor at NYU. The collection is comprised almost entirely of McNamara's subject files on the expansive breadth of theater, drama, and performance in early American, early British, and contemporary American life.</p><p>
Organized in one main series of McNamara's subject files, as well as five smaller series which document his scholarly and creative writing, the collection features prominent sections of resources on Broadway, Circuses, Environmental Performance, Fairs and Festivals, Medicine Shows, Minstrelsy, Street Entertainments, Theatre and Theatres, and Vaudeville, as well as McNamara's own work as a scholar. One is able to trace the early development of Performance Studies as a discipline through McNamara's framing of "Popular Entertainments": performance and theatre on the stage, in the street, and in everyday life.</p><p>
Collection materials consist of articles, brochures, catalogues, correspondence, drafts, magazines, manuscripts, newsletters, newspaper clippings, pamphlets, photocopies, photographs, postcards, posters, programs, student projects slides, audiocassettes, 8mm film, reel to reel video, reel to reel audio, and DVD-Rs.</p><p>
The general date range for the collection spans the early-1970s to the mid-1990s, as this is when McNamara was actively collecting these materials. However, there are also historical pamphlets and booklets dating from the turn of the century through the 1960s.</p>  </scopecontent>
