    <head>Content Description</head>
<p>The Koshland and Hertzmann Family Manuscript Cookbook Collection, which dates between the early and mid-20th century, contains four bound manuscript cookbooks with handwritten recipes, notes, and inserts by Elizabeth K. Hertzmann, her mother Berta G. Koschland, or in some cases, both women. One of the four books specifically relates to Koschland's studies at the Münchner Kochschule between 1900 and 1905. In addition to the cookbooks, the collection also contains an early, illustrated journal kept by Hertzmann while in high school, as well as a box of loose recipes. This collection documents quotidian German cooking during this time period, and Germany's influence on American cuisine.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Berta Guggenheimer Koschland trained professionally at the one of Germany's many cooking schools, the Münchner Kochschule (Munich Cooking School), as did her daughter, Elisabeth Regina Koschland. Upon arriving in the United States, Berta Guggenheimer Koschland went by the name Bertha G. Koshland, and her daughter, after marrying in 1939, became Elizabeth K. Hertzmann. Their personal cookbooks and loose recipes were eventually handed down to Peter Hertzmann, Elizabeth Hertzmann's son.</p>  </bioghist>
