      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>These files were requested, mostly during the 1970s-1980s by Harold Fruchtbaum (1933-2005), a professor at Columbia University's School of Public Health. He worked with Marshall Perlin (peripherally represented in this collection), attorney for Michael Meeropol, son of the Rosenbergs, in efforts to prove that his parents were wrongly convicted.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>Principally contains FOIA files of FBI documents, and a few from other U.S. government agencies, pertaining to the espionage trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, and that of Morton Sobell. In addition to files on the defendants and witnesses, there are files on the scientific aspects of the case against the Rosenbergs. There are also audiotapes relating to the Rosenberg case, principally  interviews with participants and authors, conducted decades after the trial, three videocassettes produced by the Instituto Cubano de Amistad con los Pueblos on the 30th anniversary of the execution of the Rosenbergs, and three 10 inch reel to reel tapes from 3rd World Newsreel, labeled June 19th [1953 - the date of the Rosenbergs's execution], two of which are labeled "pix," the 3rd, "sound roll." There are also FOIA files pertaining to the perjury trial of Alger Hiss, and some material relating to Fruchtman's activity at Columbia University's School of Public Health.</p>
