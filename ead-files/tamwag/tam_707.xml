<p>Leibel Bergman was a revolutionary communist in the United States from the late 1930s to the 1980s. He was an active member of the Communist Party of the United States in the 1930s to early 1950s, but left the party in the 1950s because his politics were viewed as too far left. He was among the founding members of several other communist organizations including the Revolutionary Union, the Revolutionary Communist Party, and the Revolutionary Workers Headquarters. He was involved in organizational activities in Minnesota, the San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago, Newark, and New York City. Bergman also spent more than two years in the People's Republic of China in the years leading up to the Cultural Revolution, and made many follow-up trips to the country in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>  </bioghist>
