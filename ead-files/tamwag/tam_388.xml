    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Joyce Wheeler was a member of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), a national teachers' labor union founded in 1900. She was particularly active in the United Action Caucus (UAC), a rank and file organization within the AFT. The UAC took stands on various issues within the American educational system, supported progressive politics in general, and campaigned for internal democracy within the AFT. Members of the Communist Party USA are thought to have played an important role in the UAC. Wheeler was also a participant in the Baltimore Teachers Union (BTU), AFT and in BTU's Teacher Unity Caucus.</p>  </bioghist>
