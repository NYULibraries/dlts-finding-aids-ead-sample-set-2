    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>David Montgomery (1927-2011) was Farnam Professor of History Emeritus at Yale University. Montgomery is considered one of the foremost academics specializing in United States labor history and has written extensively on the subject. Along with David Brody and Herbert Gutman, he is credited with founding the field of "new labor history" in the U.S. Following the example of British historian E. P. Thompson, Montgomery encouraged a generation of labor historians to examine working-class culture, rather than simply their organizations. He was also President of the Organization of American Historians from 1999 to 2000.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The 2017 accretion to the David Montgomery Papers was initially shelved upon its arrival at 20 Cooper Square, although later, in late June and early July 2017, all materials were transferred from hanging folders to acid-free folders and archival boxes. Original folder titles were retained during rehousing, and rusty fasteners were removed to prevent further deterioration. Processing information for the materials donated prior to 2017 is unknown.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The David Montgomery Papers document the professional career and, in some cases, the personal life of historian and professor David Montgomery (1927-2011).The bulk of the collection consists of Montgomery's research files, which mainly focus on the labor history of the United States, although some files describe labor movements that occurred in China, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Latin America. Materials include photocopies of articles, newspaper clippings, correspondence, printed ephemera, handwritten notes, typescripts, and FOIA files. Three boxes are specifically devoted to the FBI files of Jay Lovestone, a former Communist Party USA leader who became a militant anti-communist, specializing in combating communism in labor movements in the U.S. and abroad, was employed by the AFL-CIO for this purpose, and cooperated closely with U.S. government agencies. In addition to Montgomery's research files, the collection also contains a few awards, some materials related to Yale University where Montgomery taught, photographs, course materials (including student theses), medical records, personal financial documents (including tax returns), and child artwork.</p>  </scopecontent>
