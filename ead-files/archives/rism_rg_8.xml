The project was organized and led by Vera D. Rubin, founder and director of the Research Institute for the Study of Man (RISM), and Lambros Comitas, assistant director of RISM.  Under their direction, multiple anthropological and epidemiological teams studied six ecologically distinct communities in Bolivia in order to identify major health problems and to assess the implications of rural social organization to facilitate the work of development agencies. The collection dates from 1935 to 2006, with the bulk of the material dating between 1964 and 1967.  The collection documents the work of the project teams in Bolivia, and includes correspondence, accounting records, indexed field notes, laboratory processing records, surveys and questionnaires, maps, photographs, and films. The collection also includes materials from a 1997 exhibition, <title render="italic">Retrospect and Prospect: Preservation and Use of Archival Materials in the Digital Age</title>, about the Bolivia Project and the collection.</abstract>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>In 1964, an intensive three-year medical-anthropological research program in Bolivia was undertaken by the Research Institute for the Study of Man (RISM) at the request of the United States Peace Corps and in cooperation with the Bolivian Ministry of Public Health. The program was conducted under contract with the United States Peace Corps and received significant supplementary support from RISM. The goal of the research was to provide basic information for the development of public health and sanitation programs. Project administration was carried out by RISM director Vera D. Rubin and associate director Lambros Comitas, along with William J. McEwen, who served as the project research director, and Abdel Omran, who was director of the epidemiological research.
 
The project had two interrelated research objectives: The epidemiological team attempted to define the major problems of health and disease in rural Bolivian communities, taking into account the drastically different ecological regions of the country. The communities surveyed included Villa Abecia, Coroico, Reyes, Sorata, Compi, and San Miguel. Clinical studies were conducted on a sample of 3,000 subjects to determine the incidence of tuberculosis and parasitic infections, the major endemic diseases affecting the region, and of nutritional and health status. Simultaneously, the ethnographic team conducted community studies in the same areas to provide background data on social and cultural features with special regard to attitudes toward health and disease and the structure of local institutions in the rural communities. 
 
Over eighty medical and social scientists, field workers, nurses, data analysts, and staff in the United States and Bolivia contributed to the project. Quarterly reports describing the work and the course of research were filed with the Peace Corps. Results and analysis were published in two companion volumes: the epidemiological report, <emph render='italic'>Epidemiological Studies in Bolivia</emph>, was published by RISM in 1967, and the ethnographic report, <emph render='italic'>Changing Rural Bolivia</emph>, was published by RISM in 1969 and as <emph render='italic'>Changing Rural Society</emph> in 1971 by Oxford University Press. In addition, a number of articles, reports, theses and doctoral dissertations resulted from the project research.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Decisions regarding the arrangement, description, or physical interventions taken on this collection prior to 2017 are unknown. In 2017 an accretion of correspondence was incorporated into Series I. Correspondence based on the collection's existing arrangement structure; at this point the descriptive front matter of the collection was also revised. In 2019, materials were rehoused by ACM and Preservation staff and sent to offsite storage. In 2020, materials were rehoused and sent to offsite storage.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Records of the Research Institute for the Study of Man's Medical and Social Anthropological Research in Bolivia documents the work of anthropological and epidemiological teams in Bolivia and dates between 1935 and 2006, with the bulk of the material dating between 1964 and 1967.  Material in the collection includes correspondence, accounting records, indexed field notes, laboratory processing records, surveys and questionnaires, maps, photographs, and films.   The bulk of the collection consists of field notes taken by investigators in the course of their work, indexed cards created from these notes, and surveys and questionnaires conducted by the investigators.  The field notes contain detailed observations of the day to day activities of the investigators, including their first impressions of the communities in which they lived, their interactions with residents of the communities, and maps and drawings of the communities.  The indexed cards consist of photocopies of these notes that were organized by coded topics and cut and pasted onto cards according to these codes.  The questionnaires include information about the health of the members of the communities, their living arrangements, and their opinions of social and political structures within the community.  The surveys include information about sanitation, water supply, and livestock in the communities.  Other material in the collection includes laboratory results of blood typing tests and blood and stool sampling for infectious diseases, maps of the six communities studied, census data for the six communities, photographs taken by the investigators, reports and papers written using the data generated through the project, and material created for a 1997 exhibit about the project and its records.</p>  </scopecontent>

The questionnaires were used as a preliminary census that documented the size of households and health conditions of family members. The questionnaires are in Spanish and include information about the family member providing the information, his/her age and health history, and information about the other members of the household. Some of the community files contain health questionnaires and tuberculin surveys.  The latter consist of similar information as the healthy questionnaires and include information on tuberculosis titres taken at the time of the survey.  The survey focuses on how many people live in the house, on the health of the members of the household, whether anyone in the house was very ill in a set of time not specified on the forms, and what sort of medical treatment that person received.  The questionnaires contain the community household number, written above the page numbers, and the name of the head of household, which may also appear in the existing biographical index cards.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref244" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cedula de Salud: Compi </unittitle><unitdate normal="1964/1965" type="inclusive">1964-1965</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_9c4f937eaca45521849eba7af506aa0f" label="Mixed Materials [31142067123516]" type="box">199</container><container id="aspace_1a3fc93fc92abd90a15cfcc3312c6f6b" parent="aspace_9c4f937eaca45521849eba7af506aa0f" type="folder">1-3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref245" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cedula de Salud: Coroico</unittitle><unitdate normal="1964/1965" type="inclusive">1964-1965</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_0cfb512d24b60375ca2e8a52fe481976" label="Mixed Materials [31142067123516]" type="box">199</container><container id="aspace_6a84f085ee7d92b875b20d98c23ec156" parent="aspace_0cfb512d24b60375ca2e8a52fe481976" type="folder">4-7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref249" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cedula de Salud: Reyes</unittitle><unitdate normal="1964/1965" type="inclusive">1964-1965</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_19bb5962dbe313d252855dfb96d5485e" label="Mixed Materials [31142067123516]" type="box">199</container><container id="aspace_5959864d5267f19ffef285d3fad38953" parent="aspace_19bb5962dbe313d252855dfb96d5485e" type="folder">8-10</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref250" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cedula de Salud: Sorata</unittitle><unitdate normal="1964/1965" type="inclusive">1964-1965</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_f1f0e383724cedab3c20b095a8005867" label="Mixed Materials [31142067123516]" type="box">199</container><container id="aspace_804e282d86bc56bedb7302e2a946f267" parent="aspace_f1f0e383724cedab3c20b095a8005867" type="folder">11-14</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref589" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cedula de Salud: Cruz Loma</unittitle><unitdate normal="1965/1965">1965</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_291abafd1e7e8235c2d828990e82a611" label="Mixed Materials [31142067123516]" type="box">199</container><container id="aspace_a7625e07d2525a28e0387e56d5d04588" parent="aspace_291abafd1e7e8235c2d828990e82a611" type="folder">15</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref590" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cedula de Salud: Mururata</unittitle><unitdate normal="1965/1965">1965</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_91e5c294e3507e9841b303d1d08a833c" label="Mixed Materials [31142067123516]" type="box">199</container><container id="aspace_2a3ab3d05b42ecb43d075834631b7888" parent="aspace_91e5c294e3507e9841b303d1d08a833c" type="folder">16-17</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref591" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cedula de Salud: Bolivar Cruzani</unittitle><unitdate normal="1965/1965">1965</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_64e178f5c1ca1cf0402f8bf74b18ec66" label="Mixed Materials [31142067123516]" type="box">199</container><container id="aspace_97b2fb3b2ee084c8981e3e7af238f6f1" parent="aspace_64e178f5c1ca1cf0402f8bf74b18ec66" type="folder">18-19</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref251" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries C.

The notes are in English and Spanish.  Descriptions of medicinal plants in villages and what each can be used for; descriptions of relationships between villagers; work done by villagers; what women buy from markets, how much, and how often; health of the field workers; cattle driving routes; religious orders in the villages and religious events; fiestas in each village and the significances and different aspects (social and religious) of each.
