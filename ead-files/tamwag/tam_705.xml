      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Stephen Salant is an economist who taught at the University of Michigan from 1986 to 2015. He is most well-known for his research in the area of applied macroeconomics focusing on speculative attacks in the gold market. Salant has also maintained a continued interest in the 1949 trials of Alger Hiss and has performed independent research into evidence used during the trials. Through his research on Hiss, Salant has reexamined evidence related to the typewriter and Kodak film reels used as evidence during the trials. He argued that his research showed that the typewriter Whittaker Chambers claimed Hiss used to transcribe government documents was a forgery, and that the Kodak film reels known as the "Pumpkin Papers" were produced in the 1940s rather than the 1930s as Chambers claimed. In 1978 Salant sued the Department of Justice under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in an attempt to gain access to government records related to the trials. He has since published several articles related to his research.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Stephen Salant Research Files on Alger Hiss contain research materials and drafts related to Stephen Salant's writings on the Alger Hiss trials. Salant's research focused on reexamining evidence used against Hiss during his perjury trials, and relied largely on records obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The bulk of the collection consists of documents from Salant's 1975 FOIA lawsuit against the US Department of Justice to gain access to 5 rolls of Kodak film, which were known during the trials as the "Pumpkin Papers". Materials related to the lawsuit include FOIA request documents, copies of government documents related to the Hiss trials, and correspondence between Salant's attorney and the Department of Justice. The collection also contains drafts of Salant's writing about the Hiss trials and supporting research, which include a copy of an essay Salant wrote about the case as a student at Columbia in 1963. Research materials include correspondence with the Kodak film company regarding the dating of the film strips, and with other researchers.</p>
      <p>One box of materials added to the collection in 2017 contains additional legal briefs and proceedings from Salant's 1978 FOIA lawsuit. These materials include additional research documents related to the "Pumpkin Papers" gathered by Salant including a summary of an interview Salant conducted with HUAC investigator Donald Apel, and the correspondence of Emile Despres, economic adviser to the State Department, dated 1947-1947. Materials from this donation also include a small set of research on the National Counter Intelligence Corps Association (NCICA), including copies of its newsletter the Golden Sphinx, dated 2005-2013.</p>
