      <abstract id="aspace_4a14e5cf91689364ce3a015698d1c85d">Bowman Gum Company was a maker of collectible trading cards, primarily baseball cards. In 1951, they released a series of cards entitled the "Children's Crusade Against Communism," depicting atomic warfare, scenes of battles, notable figures in the Korean War, and negative consequences if communism were spread in the United States. The cards were marketed to children and are an example of anti-communist propaganda.</abstract>
