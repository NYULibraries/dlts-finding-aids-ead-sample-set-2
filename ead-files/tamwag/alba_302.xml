      <p>The Joseph Hecht Papers (dated 1938-1945) contain one small box of letters, poetry, photographs, and memorabilia related to Joseph Hecht's military service during the Spanish Civil War and World War II. The collection includes several of Hecht's personal items he received during his time in the Abraham Lincoln Brigades, including a wallet given to him by the Spanish War Ministry and a Communist Party of Spain membership booklet. The bulk of the collection includes documents related to Hecht's death in 1945 during World War II. They include notification of his death, letters of condolences, military correspondence regarding the posthumous military honors he received, and a flyer from a Joe Hecht memorial meeting hosted by the Union of Postal Workers of America in May 1945. The collection also contains photos of Hecht and several poems about the experience of war. The author of the poems is unclear, but they were potentially written by Hecht.</p>

      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Joseph Hecht (1906-1945) was an American soldier and volunteer in the Abraham Lincoln Brigades. He was born in New York in 1906. He joined the international brigades in December 1963, and fought with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade through many of its major engagements. He was eventually promoted to the rank of captain, and was later transferred to driving ammunitions trucks. Hecht enlisted in the United States Army during World War II in 1942. He was deployed to Germany in early 1945, but was killed in action in March of that year when he charged a German machine gun emplacement to protect other members of his battalion. As a result of his actions Hecht was posthumously granted a Silver Star and a Purple Heart.</p>
