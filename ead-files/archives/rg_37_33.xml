      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>In the early 1980s, New York University intensified its commitment to international education, community service and the global exchange of information. The University began creating centers dedicated to teaching and research on countries, cultures, and concerns abroad.</p>
      <p>During this time, NYU's 13th president, John Brademas observed a lack of information on, and awareness of Spain and Latin America in the media, academia, and countless other institutions. In 1983, Brademas began a campaign centered on increasing awareness of Spain and the Spanish-speaking world at NYU. His first step was to honor King Juan Carlos I of Spain for his leadership and defense of democratic principles by awarding him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. He then established a professorship in the King's name that went on to attract many of the world's most eminent Hispanists. During this time, he also announced his intention to create a center dedicated to the interdisciplinary study of modern Spain and the Spanish-speaking world.</p>
      <p>In April 1997, in the presence of distinguished figures from Spain, Latin America, and the U.S., including the King and Queen of Spain and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, the King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center was inaugurated. It promised to be the most comprehensive university-based resource of its sort. Housed in Judson Hall, the Washington Square Park landmark building designed by Stanford White, the Center solidified NYU's commitment to the study of Spain and Latin America. Unexpectedly, it also quickly became a major cultural resource for the city of New York, educating many in the community who might not be exposed to the cultures and history of Spain and Latin America.</p>
