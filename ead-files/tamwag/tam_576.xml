Schwarz is apparently a sincere anti-communist, but Inspector Sullivan has commented that Schwarz is the type of person largely responsible for misinforming people and stirring them up emotionally to the point that when FBI lecturers present the truth it is difficult for the misinformed to accept it.  He added Schwarz and others like him can only do the country and anti-communist work of the FBI harm."</p><p>Pg 2: "It is of course, dangerous to get too close to this group and to let them use our material for the distorted campaign they are conducting against communism.  It is felt we should firmly but politely inform them we can give no approval for the reprinting of our officially released data in their booklet nor can we lend any official endorsement to their efforts."

Needless to say, I declined the invitation."  Schwarz then asked if any other Bureau representative could appear. JEH handwrote at bottom of memo:  "Absolutely no"</p><p>Schwarz:  Educated in Brisbane schools, graduated from University of Queensland Medical School and engaged in general medical practice and psychiatry in Sydney. He also served as Chairman of Gospel Film Industry</p><p>"He is an evangelical Baptist and has been a lay preacher for many years….He first visited the United States in 1950.  He said the response to his anticommunist crusade was so great that, on his return to Australia, he gave up his medical practice and devoted his full time to his anticommunist campaign."</p><p>Pg 3: "CACC sponsors, organizes, and conducts lectures, seminars and schools on anticommunism all over the United States…Dr. Schwarz can be termed a 'professional anti-communist' for he apparently earns his livelihood from his lectures and writings…In one particular month, he delivered 26 lectures in Washington state, Texas, Iowa, Illinois and Indiana." [as originally reported in HQ 94-50868, #14]</p><p>Pg 4:  "Numerous inquiries have been received have been received by the Bureau from individuals and organizations throughout the country requesting information concerning and our evaluation of Dr. Schwarz and the CACC.  We have been recently discouraging requests for Bureau publications from persons who have been impressed and influenced by Dr. Schwarz, since he is obviously capitalizing on our reprint material."</p><p>5/29/57 = Schwarz had "Staff consultation" before House Committee on Un-American Activities.</p><p>HQ 94-50868, #82 (1/13/61 D.C.

He also was the editor of the police magazine, "Law And Order." </p><p>In 1960 he left the police force and began speaking tours around the country often under auspices of Fred Schwarz's Christian Anti-Communism Crusade.

"International Communism which is the Soviet and Red Chinese goal of the world-wide Communism under a single dictatorship."</p><p>2. "National Communism which is the one-country variety such as we have in eastern Europe and which the parties in France, Italy and England are pushing toward.</p><p>3. "Democratic Communism which is a one-world dictatorship over humanity but with democratic processes being used to give it the assemblance (sic) of people participation.  Even the Soviet Union has tried to create this illusion of people participation in their monolithic Communist dictatorship.  In the West this kind of dictatorship over people and property is often referred to as Democratic Socialism.</p><p>"Everything we read from the CFR and the Trilateral Commission…would definitely suggest that they are working for a world communal or socialist order of the so-called 'democratic' type.  The people have already demonstrated that they have practically no confidence in the people when it comes to solving their own problems.  They are determined to use compulsion on a world-wide scale in order to 'force the people to do what is good for them.'  Meanwhile, they cater to international Communism in both Russia and China with policies of détente, billion dollar loans, and generous trade policies which could be a serious threat to the security of the U.S. and the free West in the not too distant future."</p><p>Notes From Various Files Pertaining to Skousen:</p><p>10/27/61 = WC Sullivan personnel file (serial unrecorded) contains memo from Sullivan to Belmont regarding two professors who contacted Sullivan on 10/25/61 to discuss Sullivan's lectures regarding communism around the country.

He said that Skousen tries to create the impression that he is an outstanding authority on communism, precisely because he was in the FBI and for that reason should be accepted and supported in his positions, because of his FBI connections in the past.

He was a personal friend of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy and Roy Cohn.</p><p>01/30 = Associate Editor, Far Eastern Review in Shanghai, China</p><p>2/9/55 = American Jewish League Against Communism. Inc. (220 W. 42nd St – NYC, founded 1948) issued press release dated 2/14/55 to announce its new officers elected at annual meeting on 2/9/55.  Sokolsky named President, replacing Alfred Kohlberg.</p><p>11/8/55 = Featured speaker at FBI National Academy graduation exercises</p><p>4/56 = American Legion Convention in Miami passed resolution commending  Sokolsky and others for their fight against communism in their writings and radio broadcasts.</p><p>7/14/59 Sokolsky column "The Supreme Court" rejected the notion circulated by some on extreme right that the Court was making "pro-Communist" decisions.  "The problem then is not so simple.  Decisions cannot be classified as 'pro-Red' or 'anti-Red'.  The Constitution cannot be defined in such simple language.  In times of great stress, it is probable that Justices, as well as legislators, will stress security more than civil rights; in times of peace, civil rights will be stressed more than security. It is the cold war that creates the confusion."  [HQ 62-89885, #187]</p><p>3/3/61 = Received 1961 "National Award" from Young Americans For Freedom in field of journalism.</p><p>9/6/61 = J. Edgar Hoover to Sokolsky expresses "my sincere congratulations for your great column ["The Crackpots"] of September 5.  It is time someone set the record straight by exposing these opportunists who capitalize on their former employment with this Bureau.  Motivated by selfish ambition, they exploit the name and record of the FBI achieved through the years by the diligent effort and self-sacrifice of so many loyal men and women.  My associates and I deeply appreciate your excellent treatment of this matter…"   </p><p>In his column, Sokolsky observed:  "Particularly offensive are some who call themselves former FBI agents, thus giving to themselves labels which provide the appearance of special knowledge…Naturally, it is an advantage to a man to have served in the FBI but like all organizations, it has men on top and men who never rise; it has men who are efficient and those who have to be let out because they do not make good.  Employment by the FBI is not a permanent badge of efficiency, knowledge, or responsibility.  When a fellow advertises himself as a former FBI agent, the proper inquiry should be, why former? The reason I emphasize this point is that there is an upsurge of conservatism in this country and there are many opportunists who jump on the conservative bandwagon and who claim special knowledge and special advantages." [HQ 62-89885, #209, 9/6/61 JEH to Sokolsky.]</p><p>3/14/62 = C.D. DeLoach to Mr. Mohr reported a phone call DeLoach received from Sokolsky on 3/12/62. Sokolsky mentioned that Fred Schwarz objected to comments which Sokolsky made about Schwarz in a column and Schwarz asked a businessman to contact Dick Berlin of the Hearst Corporation for purpose of having Sokolsky apologize.  "George stated he told Berlin that he would refuse to apologize.  He mentioned he had explained very carefully to Berlin that Schwartz (sic) is a professional anticommunist who is in the game strictly for money purposes.  He stated he had also told Berlin that Dr. Schwartz was formerly a member of the Jewish faith but dishonored his faith and later became a Baptist and he, Sokolsky, did not trust Schwartz (sic).  George also apparently reviewed with Berlin the fact that Dr. Schwartz and Pat Frawley of the Papermate Pen Company had given Rabbi Merritt approximately $12,500 in Los Angeles so that Merritt would compound the activities of the Los Angeles branch of the American Jewish League Against Communism with Dr. Schwartz's Christian Anticommunist (sic) Crusade.  George stated that the very name of Schwartz's outfit (CACC) is an insult to the Jewish faith and, therefore, Merritt was being expelled from the American Jewish League Against Communism (Sokolsky's outfit).  He also added that Merritt undoubtedly had appropriated some of the $12,500 for his own personal use."  [HQ 62-89885, #216; 3/14/62 Cartha DeLoach to John Mohr].</p><p>6/27/62 = J. Edgar Hoover letter to Sokolsky commended his 6/26/62 column in Washington Post entitled "The Right Right" as "precise, straightforward thinking".   Hoover wrote:  "Today, there are too many self-styled experts on communism without valid credentials and without any access whatsoever to classified factual data regarding the inner workings of this conspiracy who have engaged in rumormongering and hurling false and wholly unsubstantiated allegations against people whose views differ from their own.  Conscientious newspapermen are greatly reducing the danger that these people create, and my associates and I want to express our thanks for the cooperation you have rendered in this regard."  [HQ 62-89885, #219; 6/27/62 JEH to Sokolsky]</p><p>12/61 <emph render="italic">Commentary</emph> magazine letter-to-editor by Sokolsky:</p><p>To the Editor:</p><p>In Alan F. Westin's article, "The John Birch Society," in your August issue, it is stated: "[Welch] indicates that it [the John Birch Society] has been endorsed by the American Jewish League Against Communism (a Jewish right-fundamentalist group)."</p><p>The American Jewish League Against Communism (of which I am Chairman of the Board, having previously been President) has never endorsed any organization. From its beginning, the League has held to the principle of going it alone and has had no affiliations and given no endorsements. Individual members do as they choose.</p><p>I do not know what Mr. Westin means by "right-fundamentalism." It is a contrived term that conveys no particular meaning. The American Jewish League Against Communism is opposed to Marxist-Leninist Communism in this country and views with distrust other countries which adopt this sociological and economic doctrine.  Does not Mr. Westin take the same position?

DeLoach to Mr. Mohr discusses conversation DeLoach had with Cong. Gordon Scherer  (Republican OH, on HCUA) concerning Sullivan's speeches in Cincinnati during February 1961—including one at University of Cincinnati: "In the outset, Scherer told me that he fully understood that some of our 'friends' on the extreme right wing do much more harm than good…Scherer stated that he, of course, fully understood Mr. Sullivan's approach and felt that it was a scholarly one.

Also describes him as "a recognized authority on all facets of communism.  In his appearances before public and classified audiences, Mr. Sullivan has shown a detailed and intimate knowledge of communism from a theoretical and practical standpoint.

He said that Skousen tries to create the impression that he is an outstanding authority of communism, precisely because he was in the FBI and for that reason should be accepted and supported in his positions, because of the FBI connections in the past. I assured (names deleted) that Mr. Skousen had absolutely no connection with us whatsoever at this time, and that neither he or any other former Agent should be regarded as an authority on communism merely because at one time he had worked for the FBI."   [HQ 67-205182, no serial #, 10/27/61 memo from Sullivan to Belmont in Sullivan's personnel file, pages 3-4.]</p><p>4/10/63 = Hoover wrote letter to Admissions Committee, Cosmos Club, WDC, recommending Sullivan for membership: "As Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI's Domestic Intelligence Division, Mr. Sullivan is one of the top ranking officials of this Bureau.  He entered on duty with the FBI as a Special Agent on August 4, 1941 and rose to his present responsible position because of his superior abilities and qualities of leadership.  Mr. Sullivan holds Bachelor of Arts and Master of Education degrees, and is a Research Association in the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace of Stanford University. Through study and experience, he is one of this country's outstanding authorities on communism and internal security and has served as a guest lecturer throughout the United States."

He is a Research Associate of the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, Stanford University."</p><p>10/12/70 = Sullivan speech to UPI editors at Williamsburg VA precipitated feud with Hoover because Sullivan stated that CPUSA was not particularly effective or a problem whereas New Left was (such as SDS).  According to UPI report (see NYT, 10/13/70, p27, "FBI Aide Doubts That Teds Cause Unrest in U.S.")</p><p>"A high FBI official said today the Communist Party 'is not in any way causing or directing or controlling the unrest we suffer today in the racial field and in the academic community.'  William C. Sullivan, top assistant to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, said Communists 'do attempt to exploit troubled situations' wherever they can but he said 'The Communist Party today is not nearly as extensive or effective as it was a number of years ago.'  Addressing the 1970 UPI Editors and Publishers Conference, Sullivan said the United States would be having problems 'to a greater or lesser extent if the Communist Party in this country didn't exist at all. Now, on the other side of the coin, we do have many of these students – some of their professors support them – espousing their own particular interpretation of Marx.  And they openly proclaim their Marxism.  Some go so far as to add Leninism.  There are others who embrace Trotskyite interpretation of Communist ideology generally and Marxism particularly.  There are those who accept the Chinese version.'  But the FBI official said there is no evidence that any one group of people or any single nationwide conspiracy is behind disorders on the campus or in the ghettos."</p><p>9/30/71 = Hoover letter to Sullivan relieved him of his duties and placed him on annual leave pending receipt of retirement papers. -- 10/21/71 = retired from FBI -- 1/72 = Assistant Director, Insurance Crime Prevention -- Institute -- 8/7/72 = Director, Office of National Narcotics Intelligence—Office of the Attorney General --

Sullivan replied: "…it can be said that if the only Communists in the world were those in the United States and the only Communist Party in the world was the one now existing in the United States, then, we would have to be more ashamed of the situation than afraid of it.

Belmont re ASC) has Hoover handwritten comment on page two of memo:  "Just another instance of ex-agts trading on their former FBI connections."</p><p>7/61 issue of American Legion Firing Line newsletter, pages  30-31 contained summary regarding ASC:</p><p>"Responding to the need in the business community for reliable and extensive information on Communism and other totalitarian systems, William F. Carroll, a former FBI agent, started a new organization in 1955 called the Midwest Research Library.  The following year its name was changed to American Security Council.  The President is John M. Fisher, national security coordinator for Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company.  The Council is bipartisan, non-profit association, with over 2,700 member institutions throughout the country, including business firms, newspapers, foundations and universities.  Its primary mission is the gathering, correlation, and dissemination of factual information on Communist strategy and tactics to its members.  It also provides these fine services to government agencies, congressional committees, educational institutions, and 'carefully selected writers and scholars'…ASC membership dues depend upon the size of the member institution, varying from $30 to $900 a year."</p><p>"The Council has the largest and most complete private files on Communism in the country at its main office in Chicago, located at 205 W. Monroe Street.  These files, containing the names of over 1,000,000 individuals and organizations, provide information which the FBI cannot supply, since its files are secret.  All Communist Party publications, 1800 daily newspapers, 6,000 weekly newspapers, and 200 magazines are clipped for the files.  ASC also maintains a Washington Bureau, located at 808 17th Street NW under the direction of Lee R. Pennington, a former FBI Inspector and former Director of the National Americanism Commission of the American Legion.  The ASC Washington Bureau maintains close liaison with the legislative and executive branches of government, as well as the Armed Forces. During 1960, for example, eight government agencies and two congressional committees regularly obtained information from the Council's Research and Information Center in Chicago."</p><p>"The Washington Bureau publishes the biweekly ASC Washington Report, which is devoted to national and international developments affecting national security.  The Washington Report recently began publishing special issues on major world problems.  Special Issue No. 1, dated May 1961, dealt with the security aspects of the nuclear test ban negotiations.  Special Issue No. 2 was the aforementioned report on the admission of Red China to the UN.  A third special report, devoted to the Cuban problem will be released in July.  Editor-in-Chief of the Washington Report is Admiral Chester Ward, retired Judge Advocate General of the Navy and former professor of international law at George Washington University.  The Council also publishes the ASC Newsletter, a monthly confidential service to ASC members, providing internal security information and a summary of the activities of the Communist Party USA."</p><p>"The ASC Research and Information Center in Chicago has developed a very extensive educational program.  W. Cleon Skousen, ASC Field Director and author of The Naked Communist (considered by many to be the most outstanding textbook on Communism today), has been addressing on an average of two high school student bodies a week.  Several of his talks have been recorded and are frequently played at school and public meetings.  Admiral Ward is also in great demand as a speaker…Moreover, the Council maintains a film library consisting of films, slides, and tapes which are available to a large number of groups.  In 1960, for example, the Film Library distributed over 100 copies of the film Operation Abolition to its members."</p><p>1962 = ASC created Freedom University of the Air = series of 65 one-half hour TV progams hosted by W. Cleon Skousen. However, in April 1962, former FBI Inspector Lee Pennington called the Bureau and spoke to Special Agent Joseph Sizoo.  The Bureau memo on this call reports:</p><p>"Former Inspector Lee Pennington who is now associated with the American Security Council called Monday in connection with another matter and advised that Skousen had been dropped by the ASC. He had previously represented them in connection with certain speaking commitments, but Pennington said ASC people thought he had 'gone off the deep end' and his services had been discontinued."
