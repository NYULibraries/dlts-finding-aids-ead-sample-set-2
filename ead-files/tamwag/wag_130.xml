      <p>Donated by Robert McCracken, President of the Communications Workers of America, Local 1103, in 1994. The accession number associated with this gift is 1987.013.</p>
      <p>http://www.cwa1103.org/ was initially selected by curators and captured through the use of The California Digital Library's Web Archiving Service in 2009 as part of Labor Unions and Organizations (U.S.) Web Archive. In 2015, the website was migrated to Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. In 2019,  http://www.cwa1103.org/index.cfm?zone=/unionactive/past_articles.cfm&amp;localnum=1103 was added to better capture the website. The accession number associated with this website is 2019.140.</p>
