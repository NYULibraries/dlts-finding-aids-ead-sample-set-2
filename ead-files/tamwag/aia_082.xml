The collection dates from 1868 to 2008, with these dates split into two bulk spans:  the letters date between 1868 and 1915, with the bulk between 1868 and 1894; and Lynch-Brennan's research materials dating from 1995 to 2008.  The majority of the letters were written by Mary Malone McHenry (1844-1912) and Daniel Malone.  They immigrated to the United States from Ballygub, County Kilkenny, Ireland in the mid-19th century, eventually settling in Middle Granville, New York.</abstract>

      <p>The Margaret Lynch-Brennan Collection on the Malone and McHenry Families contains letters written by members of the Malone and McHenry families and research conducted on these families by Margaret Lynch-Brennan.  The collection dates from 1868 to 2008, with these dates split into two bulk spans:  the letters date between 1868 and 1915, with the bulk between 1868 and 1894; and Lynch-Brennan's research materials dating from 1995 to 2008.  The majority of the letters were written by Mary Malone McHenry and her brother, Daniel Malone, in Middle Granville, New York to their parents in Ballygub, County Kilkenny, Ireland.  The letters relate the daily life of McHenry, Malone, their spouses, and their children.  Other letters were written by Edward Malone, Thomas Canning, James Hayden, James Pendergast, Kate Malone, Martin McHenry, Ellen Farrel, Thomas Nixon, and Stephen Gaule.  Most of the letters were written from Middle Granville, but there are some from Boston, Massachusetts; Inistioge and Carrick, Ireland; Addington, New Zealand; Chicago, Illinois; Iron Mountain, Missouri; and Wappingers Falls, New York.  Lynch-Brennan's research includes facsimiles of photographs of members of the Malone and McHenry families and a history of Mt. Carmel Church in Middle Granville; genealogical research on the Malone and McHenry families; and correspondence with Lucille Noel regarding the Malone and McHenry families.</p>
