      <p>The New York University undergraduate School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance was established in 1900 to provide professional training for students pursuing a career in business. The school was presided over by Charles Waldo Haskins, the school's founding dean. </p>
      <p>In 1972, the School of Commerce, Accounts, and Finance was renamed the College of Business and Public Administration. In 1988, alumnus Leonoard N. Stern gave the school a generous donation, allowing the school to consolidate its graduate and undergraduate facilities at NYU's Washington Square campus. The school was renamed the Leonard N. Stern School of Business.</p>
      <p>Today, NYU Stern is one of the nation's premier management education schools and research centers with a broad portfolio of academic programs at the graduate and undergraduate levels.</p>
