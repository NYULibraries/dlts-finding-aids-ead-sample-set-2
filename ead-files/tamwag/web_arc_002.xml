    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Tamiment Library, New York University began web archiving in 2007 as part of a grant given by the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIPP) of the Library of Congress. As most unions, left movements, progressive organizations, and others stop creating ephemeral material and paper based collections and move most of their administrative and informational material to the web, Tamiment continued to document the changing face of the labor and left movement into the web era. Tamiment uses the California Digital Library's Web Archiving Service (WAS) as their tool to capture and preserve websites. WAS was created in 2007 and Tamiment is one of its earliest partners. The California Digital Library provides the storage and infrastructure for the project.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Tamiment Library uses the California Digital Library's Web Archiving Service (WAS) to capture websites for historical purposes. Tamiment archivists select websites for capture based on Tamiment's collecting policy. After the site is added, the title of the site is sometimes changed to better reflect the name of the organization/project/event/site.</p><p>Sites are copied by what are commonly known as spiders, robots, or crawlers to index the website. WAS uses the Heritrix web crawler to copy (or capture) the website at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy of the website. In general, the host page of website is captured for up to 36 hours. The initial capture of a website often includes the archived version of websites that have been linked to by the host website. Websites are crawled quarterly, unless contemporary events cause rapid change to content on a website.</p><p>The archivist describes each site using subject headings, a brief description of the site and its contents, and tags. WAS arranges the websites alphabetically and preserves the websites.</p><p>In 2014, finding aids were created from the 23 original projects. Original projects were collected by topic and continue to be maintained by the archivists. Three finding aids were created based on Tamiment Library's Printed Ephemera collection categories, to provide better access across websites and collections in Tamiment Library. These finding aids were created using the XML export tool in WAS and manipulated to create DACS-compliant EAD finding aids. </p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Tamiment Library Web Collection on Labor Unions and Organizations, first began by Tamiment in 2007, contains webpages of national and regional labor unions, as well as departments and divisions of trade unions. This is an assembled collection, the websites were selected by the archivists. Most of the websites captured are either national American unions or New York metropolitan area local unions. Unions collected in this finding aid represent workers from many different industries, including the service industry, construction, communication workers, transport workers, manufacturing, government, and entertainment industries.</p><p>Union websites contain information on their committees, their constitution and by-laws, board members,  publications, organizing and mobilization materials, conference materials, member benefits and services, legislative reports and other political action committee materials, information on districts and locals, event listings, and blogs. The websites act to inform their members of their benefits and rights, as well as to create support for their initiatives. Many websites contain information related to strikes and other actions taken up by the unions and document the success and failures of the campaigns. Evidence of union collaboration and mergers are also documented in the web archives. </p><p>Other websites in this collection are related to labor education and history, cultural groups, labor festivals, labor legislation lobbying groups, labor action websites, labor councils, labor news websites, job listings, and union products. Many of these organizations are not traditionally unions, but provide support and help to organize workers for better pay, benefits, and representation in the workplace. The collection also aims to document the efforts to organize low-wage service sector workers and minority, immigrant, and female workers.</p><p>These websites contain a huge variety of media, which include videos, pdfs, blog postings (including Tumblr and Wordpress blogs), petitions, news feeds, audio, message boards, and other media. These websites often act to document and update upon the organizations' activities, schedule upcoming events, build awareness of their cause or organization, information on projects the organizations are working on, and writings and articles by members of the organization.</p><p>The web collection documents the publicly available content of the web page, it does not archive material that is password protected or blocked due to robot txt exclusions. Although Tamiment attempts to archive the entirety of a website, certain file types will not be captured dependent on how they are embedded in the site. This can include videos (Youtube, Vimeo, or otherwise), pdfs (including Scribd or another pdf reader), rss feeds/plug-ins (including twitter), commenting platforms (disqus, facebook), presi, images, or anything that is not native to the site. </p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head>
<p>Due to technical or privacy issues, archived websites may not be exact copies of the original website at the time of the web crawl.

This can include videos (including Youtube and Vimeo), pdfs (including Scribd or another pdf reader), rss feeds/plug-ins (including Twitter), commenting platforms (disqus, Facebook), presi, images, or anything that is not native to the site. Other parts of websites that the crawler has difficulty capturing includes Javascript, streaming content, database-driven content, and highly interactive content. Robot txt exclusions also change the formatting of websites from their original display, websites with robot txt exclusions often display as an index.</p><p>Keyword and file-type search are also available to archived websites through the Web Archiving Service (WAS). To search for keywords within archived websites, click a site name link in the container list. From that page, click the "search" tab on the top left corner.
