<p>This collection was discovered in the repository in 2014. At that time, a collection-level finding aid was created to describe the materials. A framed photograph of United Automobile Workers president Walter Reuther was removed from its frame and placed in an archival folder. All other materials remain in their original folders.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The collection documents Sally Genn's involvement in the labor movement in New York City through her employment with the New York City Central Labor Council and her leadership in other organizations. Notes, correspondence, programs, news clippings, conference materials, photographs, posters and fliers, and other materials highlight Genn's role in the NYC Central Labor Council, particularly her collaboration with various theatrical unions on behalf of the Council. Genn's writings and editorial work are represented in the 1975, 1977, and 1981 edition of the <emph render="italic">Trade Union Handbook</emph>, which Genn edited, and in an article she wrote for <emph render="italic">Labor Today</emph>. Other pamphlets, photographs, and news clippings collected by Genn document the Council and the labor movement in New York City more broadly.</p><p>Two United Housing Foundation scrapbooks of news clippings provide evidence of Genn's interest in the co-op movement. Also of note are notices, correspondence, and clippings from the anarcho-syndicalist organization the Libertarian Book Club, which Genn served as secretary; Labor Theater programs, posters, and reviews; and correspondence related to Genn's appointment as the Newspaper Guild of New York's representative to the Women's Trade Union League. </p><p>Most folders have titles that were likely provided by the donor, Irving Genn.</p>  </scopecontent>
