In 2012, http://www.radicalphilosophyassociation.org/ was added to the web archive. In 2015, these websites were migrated to Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. In 2018, https://www.rpamag.org/ was added to the web archive. The accession number associated with this website is 2019.106.</p>

      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Founded in 1982, the Radical Philosophy Association is an international organization whose members struggle against capitalism, racism, sexism, homophobia, disability discrimination, environmental ruin, and all other forms of domination, drawing upon a variety of radical traditions including phenomenology, Marxism, anarchism, post-structuralism, post-colonial theory and environmentalism. Its efforts center on conferences and publications. The RPA also publishes the journal <emph render="italic">Radical Philosophy Review</emph>.</p>

      <head>Custodial History</head>
      <p>The Alternative Press Center held these records until 2009 when it donated them to the Tamiment Library/Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives. The Radical Philosophy Association allowed the Tamiment Library/Wagner Labor Archives to take possession of these items in 2009 and sent additional materials in 2010. A poster for the 9th Biennial Conference was donated in 2010 and found in repository.</p>
