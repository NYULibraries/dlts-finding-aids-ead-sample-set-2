      <p>John V. Murra fought in the Spanish Civil War as a volunteer in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, 1937-1939. He also served as research assistant on Professor John Dollard's study "Fear and Courage under Battle Conditions" which collected responses from U.S. volunteers about to their reactions in battle (see Dollard Research Files collection,  ALBA #122). Murra obtained a PhD in anthropology from the University of Chicago in 1953, in the field of Latin American culture. He went on to have a distinguished career teaching at various American universities, ending up at Cornell. This collection consists of his International Brigade identity card (carnet militaire), and reprints of some of his articles on South America, mostly from the 1980s.</p>
