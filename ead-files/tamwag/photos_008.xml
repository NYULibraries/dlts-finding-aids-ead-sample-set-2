      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Charles Solomon (1889-1963) was born on New York City's Lower East Side of immigrant Jewish parents. He practiced labor law, and following his appointment, in 1936 by New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, served for almost twenty years as a judge. Solomon joined the Socialist Party in 1910 and then ran repeatedly for public office. In 1919, he and four other Socialists were elected to the New York State Assembly, but because of the Red Scare, they were all denied their seats. Solomon finally took his seat in November of 1920. Although he ran for a range of positions including Governor, United States senator, and Mayor of New York City, Solomon never won another election. In 1936 he left the Socialist Party to help found the Social Democratic Federation and the American Labor Party (ALP). Later, in 1944, he led the exodus of Socialists and trade unionists from the ALP and helped to found the Liberal Party.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The collection documents Solomon's work as a Socialist candidate and orator as well as a judge. Portraits of Charles Solomon are amply represented (13) and are supplemented by two pen and ink cartoons, as well as by a portrait in his campaign literature. Highlights of the collection are four photographs from 1932, showing Solomon, the Socialist candidate, standing on a soapbox, speaking to office workers in the Wall Street area. In addition, six photographs document Solomon's swearing-in ceremony--performed by New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia--as a judge for the city's Magistrate's Court. Solomon is surrounded by family and supporters, including International Ladies Garment Workers Union president David Dubinsky. Various photographs show Solomon in the courtroom, sometimes posed formally with other judges, sometimes in action with courtroom participants. Two blow-ups (11x14) picture Solomon at the bench in an intense interaction with courtroom participants crowded around the bench. An early group portrait (undated) poses Solomon with socialist luminaries August Claessens, Louis Waldman, Sam Orr and S.A. De Witt. Another posed portrait shows Solomon with Algernon Lee, B. Charney Vladeck, John Dewey, Norman Thomas and Rabbi Stephen Wise. Other group portraits or two-shots include Solomon speaking at Meyer London's funeral, posed with the International Ladies Garment Workers Union's All-Star baseball team, Solomon's fellow Socialist Party/Social Democratic Federation/American Labor Party member Louis Goldberg, Harry Avrutin, Abraham Cahan, and New York City African-American politician Myles Paige. Finally, the collection also includes the official certificate of appointment to the office of city magistrate signed by Mayor La Guardia.</p>
