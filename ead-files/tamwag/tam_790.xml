    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>C.I. Taylor was an American volunteer who went to fight against fascism in Spain during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) as a machine gunner. While the American volunteers are often referred to as the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, the machine gun company named and referred to themselves after the imprisoned labor leader Tom Mooney. Taylor also writes from Albacete, Spain, which served as headquarters of the International Brigades.</p>  </bioghist>
