      <p>John Pacuska was born in the coal mining town of Pittston, Pennsylvania. He served in the Navy for two years following World War II. In 1951, Pacuska and others from Pittston were recruited to work at Camp Tamiment, an educational and recreational summer resort for socialists and their families located near Bushkill, Pennsylvania. Pacuska worked as a waiter at the camp to help pay for his college education. He went on to have a career as a psychologist. Pacuska is retired and currently resides in Fountain Valley, California.</p>
