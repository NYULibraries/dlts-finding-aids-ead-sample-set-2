Alger Hiss was a State Department official who was accused of Soviet espionage, and was eventually convicted of perjury in 1950. Interviews in the collection were recorded between 2001 and 2004 as part of an oral history project created by The Nation Institute following Hiss's death in 1996, and feature individuals who spent time with Hiss later in his life. Interviewees discuss their personal relationships with Hiss between the 1970s and 1990s, and focus on impressions of him during those years. Several interviewees were among a group of young volunteers who read books to Hiss when he began to lose his eyesight. Many interviews focus on how the interviewees' personal relationships with Hiss shaped their views about the charges against him.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Nation Institute Oral History Collection on Alger Hiss was created by The Nation Institute with funding from the Isabel Johnson Hiss Fund. The project was initiated shortly after Alger Hiss's death in 1996 to record his friends' and family's memories about him. </p>
      <p>Alger Hiss (1904-1996) was a State Department official who served in the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and was involved in the establishment of the United Nations. In 1948 Hiss was named as a communist by Whittaker Chambers in a hearing before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Hiss was called before HUAC to testify and later filed a defamation lawsuit against Chambers. During the trial process Chambers produced evidence that Hiss had been involved in espionage, and in 1950 Hiss was sentenced to three years in prison for perjury.</p>

      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>At the time of processing, oral history interviews were arranged in alphabetical order, and brief descriptions were created for each interview. Physical transcripts, which were originally grouped in booklets by the donor,  have been maintained in their original order.</p>
      <p>Duplicate transcripts both in paper and electronic formats were removed from the collection. Additionally, tapes were originally accompanied by notes listing the names of individuals mentioned in each interview. These notes were discarded because they were deemed to contain insufficient contextual or descriptive information.</p>
      <p>In 2021, electronic transcripts of about 26 of the interviews were processed and added to the collection. </p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Nation Institute Oral History Collection on Alger Hiss (dated 2001-2004) consists of 41 interviews with individuals acquainted with Alger Hiss. Interviews were conducted between 2001 and 2004 and largely feature individuals who were close with Hiss later in his life. Several of the individuals featured were life-long friends, but others featured are younger individuals who were recruited to read for Hiss as his sight began to fail him in his old age. Interviews focus primarily on the subjects' personal relationships with Hiss, their perceptions of him as a person, his intellectual and literary interests, and his family life. They also feature discussions about Alger Hiss's trials and the continued analysis of the evidence against him. These discussions address topics including Whittaker Chambers's accusations, evidence introduced during the trials, the 1996 release of the Venona papers, Allen Weinstein's book <emph render="italic">Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case</emph>, and Russian historian Dimitri Volkogonov.</p>
      <p>A large portion of the interviews were conducted by Albert Rubin, who was the first historian working on the Alger Hiss Oral History Project. Other interviews were conducted by oral historian Jeff Kisseloff and Hiss's attorney Ellyn Polshek, both of whom continued the project after Rubin retired in 2002. Interviews are recorded on audio cassette with accompanying physical or electronic transcripts. The interview with Victor Chapin does not have an audio recording and is only available in a transcript.</p>

          <p>This interview was conducted by Albert Ruben on February 1, 2001. In this interview Victor Brudney shares personal anecdotes about his friendship with Alger Hiss, who he met in 1965. Much of the interview focuses on Hiss's close connection to Harvard Law School, where Brudney later went on to teach.  He also talks about serving as a witness on Hiss's behalf during his application to be readmitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1974.

          <p>This interview was conducted by Jeff Kisseloff on October 21, 2002. In this lengthy three-part interview Tim Hobson talks about his relationship with his step-father Alger Hiss and his memories of the Whittaker Chambers allegations. In the first part Hobson talks about his mother Priscilla Hiss, his father Thayer Hobson, and his relationship with Alger Hiss. The first part of the interview also focuses on the testimony of Whittaker Chambers, and Hobson's memories of the years in which Chambers claimed to be associated with the Hiss family. The second part of the interview largely focuses on Hiss's life after his conviction and his release from prison. Much of this section focuses on family dynamics between Hiss, his son Tony, and his second wife Isabel. The third part of the interview returns to Chambers's account of his relationship with Hiss and contains some more pointed questions about the degree to which his testimony conflicts with Hobson's memories.</p>

          <p>This interview was conducted by Albert Ruben on August 10, 2001. In this interview William A. Reuben discusses his research on the Alger Hiss case and his acquaintance with Hiss.  Reuben explains that he met Hiss in 1954 when he began research on a book about the Hiss-Chambers case. They later served as co-plaintiffs in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit seeking to gain access to files related to his case. Reuben spends much of the interview discussing his research into Hiss's trial and talking about his impression of Whittaker Chambers. Reuben also talks about interviewing Max Bedacht and Sender Garlin, who Chambers had mentioned in his testimony to the FBI, and talks about how their recollections correspond with Chambers's account. He also shares his opinions about Hiss's attorney Claude Cross.</p>

          <p>This interview was conducted by Albert Ruben on April 20, 2001. In this interview Robert von Mehren talks about his acquaintance with Alger Hiss and the Hiss trials. He begins by explaining that he first met Hiss in 1948 when Whitney Debevoise, whose legal firm represented Hiss, asked for assistance on the libel suit against Whittaker Chambers. Von Mehren talks about advising Hiss's lawyers on responding to subpoenas from the House Un-American Activities Committee and the Grand Jury in New York, and offers his perspectives on the mistakes he believes were made by Hiss and his legal team during the libel suit and subsequent perjury trials. Von Mehren also shares his opinions about the personalities of Whittaker Chambers and Hiss.</p>
