      <abstract id="aspace_b2679af17cc669573f50220866979613">In 1996, Joe Glazer donated to the Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives a collection of tapes and records from among the more than two dozen he produced over the course of more than 50 years as "labor's troubadour."   His voice and guitar have been heard at scores of picket lines, union halls, and union and political rallies from the merger convention of the AFL-CIO in 1955 to the Solidarity Day demonstration in 1980.  He has revived dozens of labor songs as well as composing some which have become traditional including "The Mill was Made of Marble," "Automation," and "Too Old to Work, Too Young to Die."  He is a founder of the Labor Heritage Foundation, a national organization which promotes labor music, drama and culture and for the past twenty years, has organized an annual "Labor Arts Exchange" at the George Meany Center in Silver Spring, Maryland.</abstract>
