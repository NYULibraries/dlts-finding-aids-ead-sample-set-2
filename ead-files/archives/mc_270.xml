    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>In the fall of 2010, New York University's administration unveiled "NYU 2031," a significant expansion of NYU's Greenwich Village campus. The plan consisted of constructing four towers onto the two residential blocks between LaGuardia Place and Mercer, 3rd, and Houston Streets: a project taking potentially 20+ years of demolition and construction, and removing 2.84 acres of green space, at a cost of approximately $6 billion. </p><p>Upon learning of this plan, a group of NYU professors organized to call for reconsideration of the project by forming NYU Faculty Against the Sexton Plan (NYUFASP). The group sought to inform faculty about the project's academic consequences and financial risks, unite community neighbors in their opposition to the project, and to inform the public that NYU 2031 was, in their opinion, not benefiting faculty and students. With a membership over 400 professors, including tenured and non-tenured faculty, NYUFASP played a leading role in the broad-based resistance to the Sexton Plan. </p>  </bioghist>
