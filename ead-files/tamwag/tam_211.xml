      <p>The Mid-Atlantic Radical Historians Organization (MARHO) was formed during a conference at Fordham University in January 1973, attended mostly by professors at colleges and universities in the metropolitan New York area. The members of the conference who formed MARHO sought to foster communication among radical historians through the creation of a membership directory, the sponsorship of additional conferences, and the establishment of a newsletter containing "discussions of subjects of mutual concern and announcements of activities in the region." MARHO's quarterly newsletter was the beginning of the <emph render="italic">Radical History Review</emph>, which is currently published by Duke University Press. The journal seeks to "address issues of gender, race, sexuality, imperialism, and class" and stretch "the boundaries of historical analysis to explore Western and non-Western histories." In addition to articles on the theme of any given issue, the journal is often comprised of sections dedicated to teaching and public history, as well as reviews of television, books, museum exhibitions, and other media.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The first 24 boxes of the collection are undescribed.</p>
      <p>The collection is mainly comprised of the records of the <emph render="italic">Radical History Review</emph> Editorial Collective/Editorial Steering Committee (including meeting minutes and editorial guidelines) and MARHO's general minutes and by-laws. The collection also documents MARHO's involvement with the New York City Public History Project and the <emph render="italic">Radical History Review</emph>'s relationship with Duke University and other past distributors. Box 32 contains the records from individual issues of RHR from the late 1970s to the 2000s. Boxes 33-35 contain issues and articles on microfilm and floppy disks.</p>
      <p>Box 37 was added to the collection in 2016 and contains certificates and awards granted to the <emph render="italic">Radical History Review</emph> by the Council of Editors of Learned Journals between 2003 and 2013.</p>
      <p>The 2019 accretion in Boxes 38-39 consists of MARHO meeting minutes, reports, correspondence, memos, administrative materials, printed ephemera, and audiovisual material from 1976-1984. Minutes and reports make up the majority of the materials. There are three audiocassette tapes documenting E. P. Thompson's 1/30/1981 talk on Tom McGrath at a MARHO Forum at John Jay College. </p>
