The collection contains correspondence, flyers, newsletters, and other documents produced by the Coalition particularly in reference to school board elections, parents associations, racial issues, and boycotts. There are some photographs. The Coalition opposed the slates of candidates endorsed by the United Federation of Teachers, and many of their policies and political positions. Material is in several languages including English, Spanish, and Chinese.</abstract>
