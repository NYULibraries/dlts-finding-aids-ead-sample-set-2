    <abstract id="aspace_181fa3847624b114f29723e056d3c2b2">Active from 1979-1996, Group Material was an artists' collaboration that produced over forty-five projects addressing a wide range of social, political, and artistic issues.  Members included Doug Ashford, Julie Ault, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Mundy McLaughlin, Karen Ramspacher and Tim Rollins, among others.  The collective also worked with artists such as Vito Acconci, Mike Glier, Barbara Kruger, Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Faith Ringgold, Martha Rosler, Andres Serrano, Nancy Spero, Anton van Dalen, Carrie Mae Weems, and many others.  Materials in the collection document the origins, processes and context of Group Material's activities.</abstract>

<p>The Group Material archive is comprised of working notes, meeting minutes, proposals, posters, flyers, announcements, installation photographs, source material, press releases, magazine articles, reviews, financial documents, color slides, catalogs, audio tapes, video tapes, computer discs, artifacts, artworks, ephemera, and exhibition materials. Julie Ault assembled the archive in the summer and fall of 2008, with contributions from Doug Ashford, Sonia Finley, Sabrina Locks, and Rasmus Röhling.</p><p>The archive also includes artwork by Vito Acconci, Dennis Adams, Ida Applebroog, Doug Ashford, Julie Ault, Jimmy De Sana, Gran Fury, Mike Glier, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Michael Jenkins, Barbara Kruger, Mundy McLaughlin, Aric Obrosey, Saul Ostrow, Richard Prince, Tim Rollins, Martha Rosler, Andres Serrano, Kiki Smith, Nancy Spero, Haim Steinbach, Carrie Mae Weems, among many others. </p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Provenance</head>
<p>Julie Ault assembled the Group Material Archive by compiling her own material, which included some that was previously integrated from Mundy McLaughlin and Tim Rollins, and combining it with material from Doug Ashford and from other group members. NYU Libararies acquired the Group Material Archive in 2008.</p><p>Ault outlines her archiving process in greater detail in the book <emph render="underline">Show and Tell: A Chronicle of Group Material</emph>:  </p><p>"The group's material traces had been dispersed since 1983 when the collaborative decided it would no longer maintain an exhibition space or headquarters and instead function nomadically, working from members' homes and aided by the temporary infrastructural support of art institutions that invited GM to make projects. Decentralized, members kept their own paper trails or not. While no single person had the official responsibility of keeping up documentation of GM's process and projects, former member Mundy McLaughlin did so for the most part until 1986, at which point I took over the informal role, as well as the files. Founding member Tim Rollins gave me his files soon after. Others who left did not turn their collected material over to those who continued. What remains tangible for the archive, thirty years after GM's founding, is a
mixture of several individuals' saving habits stimulated by idiosyncratic, conceptual, and practical factors. Some of what was saved is of ambiguous value and much that should have been kept was not. Things got lost and thrown out early on because as barely solvent young New Yorkers we had space constraints and moved frequently."</p>  </custodhist>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>"Group Material was founded by a number of artists who sought a collaborative practice in which they could fuse their interests in art and politics. The original thirteen members included Tim Rollins, Patrick Brennan, Julie Ault, Mundy McLaughlin, Marybeth Nelson, and Beth Jaker. In 1980 and 1981 Group Material operated a storefront exhibition space on East Thirteenth Street, where it staged a series of shows focused on social themes.</p><p>After 1981 the group shrunk to three members and chose not to maintain its own space but instead to create installations in existing venues (alternative art spaces, university galleries, and museums) and multiform projects in public (primarily through interventions using public advertising spaces). Doug Ashford joined the group in 1982, Felix Gonzalez-Torres in 1987, Karen Ramspacher in 1989, and Thomas Eggerer and Jochen Klein in 1995. Group Material's dense installations were typically thematic and combined fine art in various media and styles, mass-produced items, and artifacts to form designed environments. These exhibitions were concerned with topical issues or debates in culture and politics and were institution- or site-dependent, such as "Subculture" on the IRT subway trains in 1982; "Democracy" at the Dia Art Foundation in 1988; and "AIDS Timeline" at the University Art Museum, University of California at Berkeley, in 1989. Group Material ceased its activities in 1996."</p><p>- Excerpt from <emph render="italic">Alternative Art New York: 1965–1985</emph>, University of Minnesota Press and The Drawing Center, 2002., edited by founding member Julie Ault</p><p><emph render="bold">Chronology:</emph></p>    <chronlist>
