    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>Founded in 1982 by Louis P. Maletta, the Gay Cable Network was the premiere chronicler of major events and personalities of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community for nearly two decades. Broadcast on public access television in New York City and other major cities worldwide, GCN covered key LGBT civil rights battles, five presidential conventions, as well as the AIDS pandemic and social protests often marginalized in the mainstream media. On televised programs like Gay USA, Pride and Progress, The Right Stuff, Men and Films, Candied Camera, In the Dungeon, and Lavender Health, GCN conducted numerous interviews with leading politicians, medical and educational professionals, entertainers, and social activists.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Under the direction of Lou Maletta, and broadcast on Manhattan Cable Television Channel 35, Gay Cable Network (GCN) began in 1982 and stopped production in 2001. GCN was the first network in the nation to openly appeal to a gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender audience. GCN initially broadcast a series titled "Men in Films," which explored the gay male image in media and male erotica, and the network soon evolved to host a wider variety of content, including news and current affairs programs which covered political developments affecting the LGBT community and the AIDS/HIV epidemic. Throughout its time, GCN provided coverage of the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, with on-floor correspondents interviewing candidates and delegates, as well as coverage of the 1987 and 1993 LGBT rights marches on Washington. A documentary aired on GCN, "Out in the 90's," earned the network a Special Recognition Award at the inaugural GLAAD Media Awards in 1990.</p>  </bioghist>

Maletta and the team cover the Republicans support of abstinence-only education and criminal prosecution for 'anyone who knowingly[â¦]transmit[s] the AIDS virus.' Republican party statements on AIDS prevention are displayed on-screen, including 'We reject the notion that the distribution of clean needles and condoms are the solution to stopping the spread of AIDS.', and stresses 'marital fidelity, abstinence, and a drug-free lifestyle.' The statement also lauds the Boy Scouts of America for 'defending decency' and calls for the disbanding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The final statement: "Unlike the Democratic party and its candidate, we support the continued exclusion of homosexuals from the military as a matter of good order and discipline."</p><p>COMMERCIAL: QW Magazine</p><p>3.

When asked if he's talked to Cammermeyer's children, Dornan states "I've seen them interviewed. It tore that family apart as it always does." Dornan states that gay men in the military would do nothing but have sex with each other and destroy morale. Dornan states that monogamous gay relationships don't exist. Elanor Van Middlesworth, a delegate, is interviewed and states that gays and lesbians should not have equal rights and should instead 'control themselves'. "I don't like to say gay, I like to say homosexual." Van Middlesworth also makes bizarre statements about the Cracker Barrel controversy that gays should not 'handle food' because customers might get AIDS. Michael Undseth, a delegate, is asked what he would do if his son came out to him: "He wouldn't. Because he's not."
