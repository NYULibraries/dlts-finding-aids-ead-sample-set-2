The tape was recorded on April 15, 1994, and only features recordings of the morning sessions of the conference. The day-long symposium was organized by the CUNY Center for the Humanities as a tribute to Howe following his death and featured and featured speakers including Mitchell Cohen, Michael Walzer, Marshall Berman, John Hollander, Morris Dickstein, Richard Rorty, Allen Mandelbaum, and Celia Morris. The conference focused on topics that had been of special interest to Howe during his career, including politics, Yiddish and Jewish culture, and the modern literary imagination.</abstract>
