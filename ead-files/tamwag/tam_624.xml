      <p>The collection consists of two scrapbooks kept by Anna and Max Sherover in the early 1900s. One focuses on the political activities of Max Sherover and to a lesser extent on the activities of Anna Sherover, his wife and "active comrade." The second scrapbook contains announcements, invitations, responses, and photographs pertaining to the opening of the Granada Hotel in Brooklyn, built by Max and his brother, Miles. Also included in the collection is a flash drive containing digital copies these materials, which are in fragile condition.</p>
