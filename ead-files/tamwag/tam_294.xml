The collection primarily documents her interest in and activism on behalf of women in the workplace, particularly office workers. The majority of the collection is comprised of subject files containing interview transcripts, reports, newsletters, notes, and other materials produced by Chamberlin or various women's rights groups, primarily dating from the 1970s. These materials pertain to affirmative action and discrimination in the workplace, especially as applied to women's compensation and working conditions.</abstract>

      <p>In 2014, a collection-level finding aid was created to describe the materials from the existing collection, as well as the new materials that were discovered in the repository in 2014. No physical processing or arrangement was done at this time. Materials remain in their original housing.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The collection primarily documents Annie Chamberlin's interest in and activism on behalf of women in the workplace, particularly office workers. The majority of the collection is comprised of subject files containing interview transcripts, reports, newsletters, notes, and other materials produced by Chamberlin or various women's rights groups, primarily dating from the 1970s. These materials pertain to affirmative action and discrimination in the workplace, especially as applied to women's compensation and working conditions. The collection also includes reports, news clippings, fliers, brochures, and other forms of printed ephemera on more general women's issues, including the Equal Rights Amendment, International Women's Day, and women's rights in Cuba.</p>
      <p>To a much lesser extent, the collection documents the efforts to unionize employees and the various contract negotiation campaigns at Columbia University and Barnard College in the early 1970s. The activities of Columbia University's Ad Hoc Committee for Organizing, which sought to affiliate non-union supporting and administrative staff at Columbia with District 65 of the Distributive Workers of America, are particularly well documented. </p>
      <p>The collection also includes a draft of part of Chamberlin's Barnard College thesis on the decision-making processes at small colleges (using Barnard as a case study), along with her notes and research materials. Also of note is the file on Chamberlin maintained by the New York Police Department's "Red Squad." A small number of fliers, news releases, and other materials pertain to a protest held against McGeorge Bundy when he was selected as the CUNY Graduate School's commencement speaker in 1980.</p>
