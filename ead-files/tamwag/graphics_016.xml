    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Lea Lerner was a music teacher at Camp Wo-Chi-Ca for several years after World War II. Camp Wo-Chi-Ca (which stood for Workers Children's Camp) was a children's summer camp in New Jersey. The camp, which was founded in 1934 and ran through the early 1950s, was mainly organized by the International Workers Order (I.W.O.) and was affiliated with the Communist Party, USA.</p><p>During the 1950s, Lerner and her family provided a safe house for underground activists Gil Green and Henry Winston.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The collection contains a variety of graphic and photographic materials, most of which relate to Camp Wo-Chi-Ca. Ten silk-screened images on construction paper, which appear to be part of a book on a gentleman nicknamed "Mendy," were produced at Camp-Wo-Chi-Ca. There are also two photographs, one of Vaino Hill, a caretaker at Wo-Chi-Ca, and the other of a memorial plaque or grave marker for two men who died in the Spanish Civil War, Ralph Wardlaw and Wilfred Mendelson (possibly the "Mendy" referenced in the silk-screen images). There is also a black-and-white print (possibly a woodblock) depicting two men drawing a plow, as well as a watercolor portrait attributed to "J. Calazzi."</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Materials have been rehoused in archival folders. Acid free paper was interleaved to separate graphic materials from the photographs.</p><p>Upon acquisition, Lea Lerner's donation of photographs and graphic materials was established as two separate collections, the Lea Lerner (Camp Wo-Chi-Ca) Photographs (PHOTOS 173) and the Lea Lerner (Camp Wo-Chi-Ca) Graphics (GRAPHICS 016). In 2013, the photographs collection was incorporated into the graphics collection, forming the Lea Lerner Camp Wo-Chi-Ca Graphics and Photographs (GRAPHICS 016).</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Separated Materials</head>
<p>In 1994, some materials from the original donation were separated to other collections or were deaccessioned. Framed copies of reproductions of Spanish Civil War watercolors were deaccessioned and offered for sale at a Tamiment Library book sale. Twelve phonograph records from August 1947 Camp Wo-Chi-Ca events were separated to the "Tamiment Library sound collection," a possible reference to the Miscellaneous Historic Sound Collection (OH 035). Clothing possibly worn by Henry Winston as a disguise while traveling underground in 1954 or 1955 was separated to the General Tamiment and Wagner Ephemera and Artifacts Collection (EPHEMERA 001). Papers were also separated, possibly to the "Camp Wo-Chi-Ca" folder in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives Vertical Files: Subjects (ALBA VF 1).</p>  </separatedmaterial>
