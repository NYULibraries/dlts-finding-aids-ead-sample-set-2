      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Dave Newman was a frame worker for the New York Telephone Company and a member of Communications Workers of America (CWA), Local 1101.  His clash with the CWA leadership, and especially the administration of local president Ricky Carnivale led to a major legal struggle.</p>
      <p>In 1975, Newman was elected as a CWA, Local 1101 steward by the workers at 104 Broad Street.  Following his criticism of the CWA leadership in his regular column for the rank-and-file publication <emph render="italic">Broad Street News</emph>, he was removed from office by the Local Executive Board in December 1976.  A protracted legal battle ensued, and Newman was eventually reinstated, on free speech grounds, by a court order in 1979.</p>
      <p>Newman later ran for election as business agent for the Southern Division of CWA Local 1101, and although his campaign was unsuccessful, he was able to mobilize a rank and file movement within the Local.</p>
